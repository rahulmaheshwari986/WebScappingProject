                "reviews": "\nCRITIQUE \r\n\r\n1. If you want to know what this movie is about, then simply watch Star \r\nWars Episode IV (A New Hope), because the story is nearly verbatim with \r\nelements thrown in from episodes V and VI for good measure.\r\n\r\n2. The leads who take the rein from the old Star Wars Universe are: \r\nHispanic, black, and a woman. There is nothing wrong with this in and \r\nof itself, but when it is done simply to be politically correct, then \r\nthe story suffers. I think one critic describes this best when she \r\nsaid, \"For the first time in Star Wars history, a franchise will be \r\nbuilt around the adventures of the sort of people that Hollywood \r\nroutinely overlooks: women and people of color. So even if The Force \r\nAwakens sucks, it's made one big diverse achievement for Hollywood.\" \r\nThis means the only place you will see an honest review of this movie \r\nis in the user reviews here at IMDb\r\n\r\n3. Luke is now Obi Wan, his long lost daughter is the new hope, and his \r\nnephew is the new Darth Vader\r\n\r\n4. They broke nearly every rule established by the original Star Wars. \r\nJedi talent no longer takes years of training, nor does one need to be \r\nstrong with the force to hold his own in a light saber battle against a \r\ntrained Sith lord, etc.\r\n\r\nWHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE\r\n\r\nThere are 100 places they could have taken this story. They could have \r\nmade Jar Jar a secret Sith lord who was playing dumb all these years, \r\nthey could have worked in elements of Star Wars Rebels and made Ezra a \r\nSith lord, or they could have had it where Luke turned to the dark \r\nside. I even heard early rumors that they were going to have Finn find \r\nLuke's severed hand with a light saber in it.\r\n\r\nTo me, it would have made the most sense to do a story where the \r\nRepublic is now the political force of the Galaxy and the First Order \r\nare the rebels. Luke could have been training a new Jedi order and they \r\ncould have shown a growing Sith threat, with a real villain and not the \r\nweanie in panties that we got in this movie, throughout the battles \r\nwith the First Order. They could have made Hans more distinguished \r\n(after all he was a King and it's been 30 years, so he should have \r\ngrown up by now). Instead, we got the same Han Solo from 1975 but who \r\nlooked 40 years older and disheveled. I'm sure Harrison Ford had no \r\nintention of doing another Star Wars movie and insisted that this would \r\nbe the last one. So he would have been killed off no matter what. \r\nHowever, it could have been far less predictable and more creative and \r\ntouching. If they wanted to keep the story line they went with, then \r\nthey still could have started this way and shown how Kylo Rey was \r\nturning to the dark side.\r\n\r\nAny of these would have been far better than the trash I saw tonight. \r\nIt's amazing how I could think of these story lines (as I'm sure can \r\n1000s of other Star Wars fans) but none of the so called talented \r\nwriters, producers, and directors in Hollywood can do this? This simply \r\namounts to lazy writing and oversight.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause everything was so predictable and the story was a rehash of \r\nwhat we already saw, the movie was BORING! It's amazing how Hollywood \r\ncan continue to put out movies like this, cheat their viewers, and then \r\nwonder in astonishment why everyone stays home to stream or pirate \r\nmovies. Maybe it's because more and more movies these days simply \r\nsupport overpaid political activists whose only creative effort is to \r\nmake a political statement at the expense of entertainment.\r\n\r\nI'm done with Star Wars. I don't need to see episodes VIII or IX, \r\nbecause I already know what is going to happen. Episode VIII and IX \r\nwill be remakes of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with \r\nRen as Luke, Luke as Obi Wan, and Kylo Rey as Darth Vader. I'm sure \r\nVIII will have the surprise statement by Kylo Rey when he battles Ren \r\nsaying, \"Ren, I am your cousin,\" and IX will end with Ren bringing Rey \r\nto the good side with little furry creatures celebrating in tree tops \r\nand the ghosts of Luke and Han looking approvingly over the scene. \r\nYeah, been there done that, there is no sense in my wasting money or \r\ntime to do it again.\r\n\r\nStar Wars is Dead! Thanks Disney and Abrams and you politically correct \r\nwhackos. Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nA NOTE ON POSITIVE REVIEWS\r\n\r\nAfter reading many of the positive reviews, I can only come to the \r\nconclusion that 1/3 of them are written by hard core Star Wars fans who \r\nwill rave about anything with the \"Star Wars\" logo attached to it and \r\nwill refuse to their dying day that they were wrong about this movie, \r\n1/3 by people who never saw Star Wars and accept this cheap rip off \r\nbecause it is the only version of the story they have seen, and 1/3 by \r\nstudio hacks.\r\n\r\nThe positive reviewers have also resorted to calling the negative \r\nreviewers \"Haters.\" It's amazing how convenient it is today for people \r\nto throw that word around to discredit anyone who has a differing \r\nopinion. That should tell you everything you need to know about the \r\ncharacter and honesty of the positives reviewers.\n"

Many people pointed out correctly that this was\na remake of various parts from previous movies. The only part which was\ngood was acting by Han Solo and a few good jokes but even then they\nkilled him and how, by his son ! How could Kylo Ren take off his mask\nthat fast in front of Rey without any mystery remaining for the next\nchapter ? J.J. Abrams did a great job in turning Star Trek from a\nboring movie into something close to Star Wars Clone Wars but he killed\nthis one, he totally led himself by Disney CEO's - shame on you J.J.\nAbrams !!! Also how could a girl or a boy who never was trained in\nlight saber duels face a Sith ( was he even a Sith-Apprentience ?)Yes\nthe new droid was great and fun, a few good jokes here and then but the\nspirit of star wars is gone ..... even in the phantom menace and clone\nwars they at least showed / introduced a planet with its creatures\ncombined with great music and have build up to every scene .... so gone\nis my love for star wars !!!\n"

I was so certain this movie would be great and I was so looking\nforward to it I bought two lots of tickets, 2 to the midnight screening\nand 2 for the next day. After this movie I will never watch Star Wars\nmade by Disney ever again. As has already been said this movie is a bad\nremake of a classic, there is absolutely nothing original in here, I\nmean seriously a droid on a secret mission on a desert planet, on the\nsame planet Catniss Ever...oops I mean Rey a Force sensitive young\nperson with unknown parentage, Death Star 3.0 and they still haven't\nworked out how to protect that main reactor...really?? And the scary\nthing is I could have lived with that but here's the bit that left me\nreally depressed. Han Solo has gone from being a Smuggler to a General\nand a war hero, back to a smuggler and the kind of guy who abandons his\nwife and friends and then he's dead, and no one cares! Even Chewie is\nupset for about 30 seconds; all I can say is they must have good Prozac\nin this Galaxy. Luke goes from farm boy, to hero pilot, to Jedi\nto...hermit???? It makes them both look like cowards and these are not\nthe characters I grew up with. This is NOT character development, this\nis regression and lazy story telling and there's lazy story telling\nthroughout this movie. We're supposed to believe these two heroic\nindividuals who always stood with their friends and faced the Emperor\nand Vader have run crying because Kylo Ren killed a few people and then\nthey left Leia to clean up the mess. The new villain is completely\nunconvincing and throws tantrums, presumably because his parents never\nloved him enough or whatever. I loved the Originals because of the\ncharacters and how steadfast they were together, this has forever\ndestroyed that. Leia should be running the government, Han should be\ncommanding a fleet and Luke should be training Jedi. The New Order\nshould be the Rebellion. and the new villain should not be a\nSkywalker...this is another I am your father moment and it's bad. If\nyou take the special effects out of this movie you have a bad bit of\nfan fiction. No Hope rather than a New Hope - this movie has no heart\nat all.\n"

The entire movie theater was quiet after the\nmovie was over and it looked like a funeral. This movie was so\npredictable and there were plot holes everywhere. The character\ninteractions felt inauthentic. It's weird how Finn and Poe became best\nfriends instantly. I also didn't like that Rey's character learned how\nto use the force, ride the falcon, and fix random things like an expert\nout of nowhere with no training. I like strong female characters like\nAshoka, but I don't like it when the male characters respond to\neverything cool she does as if it was unexpected; this happens many\ntimes throughout the movie. I also hated the villains. Snoke looked\nlike Voldemort and looked like a giant troll at first with bad cgi. Ren\nstarts off cool and turns into whiny b*** as the movie goes on. I see a\nlot of people who liked it or who have been paid to like it saying that\nif you didn't like this movie that it means you didn't like the\noriginal trilogy. Thats BS. I love star wars and enjoyed episodes 1-6.\nThis movie is so bad that I miss the creativity of Episode 1. Episode 1\nwas weak, but at least it was original. This movie felt like Age of\nUltron and the Transformers movies. George Lucas needs to come back. He\nat least cared about storytelling.\n"

The mentioned invasion\napproximately occupies the first 15 minutes of the film, when the\nobligatory huge spaceships occupy the heaven of Earth and unleash four\ndestructive \"waves\", starting by a magnetic pulse which leaves humanity\nwithout electricity; then, there are earthquakes and swells which\ndestruct coastal areas; and finally, the bird flu which to infect the\nrest of the population. So, the few survivors get organized into\nimprovised militias waiting for the feared \"fifth wave\"... but all that\nwill have to wait while we follow the girl Callie in the search of her\nbrother Sam, in which she will experience (tedious) adventures and find\n(insipid) romance with a survivor hiding a dangerous secret. Meanwhile,\nwe watch Sam and Ben, a school partner of Callie's, initiating their\ntraining as soldiers in order to fight against \"the others\" (like the\naliens call them), destructing their innocence while acquiring the\nruthless aptitude to kill other people. In summary, we basically have\nThe Road for teenagers on the one hand, and on the other hand, Full\nMetal Jacket also for teenagers. The result: incredibly boring and\nabsolutely inert. That was exactly what I expected from the romantic\nsub-plot; but I also found the rest (formed by apocalyptic drama,\naction scenes and the general tone of the movie) soporific. We never\nfeel any suspense of the desperation of human species in danger of\nextinction. The scale of the unimaginable tragedy witnessed by the\nsurvivors is immediately forgotten, in order to give way to the trite\njuvenile drama. I think I have seen films in the SyFy channel with a\nbigger emotional impact and more endearing characters. After all, The\n5th Wave ends up ignoring the extraterrestrial invasion because its\nmercenary purpose was employing the end of the world as a simple\nbackground to the usual romantic triangle between a girl, her\nmysterious savior and the school partner she has always been fond of.\nThe 5th Wave is an absolute waste of time, and I really struggle to\nfind a single positive element to mention about it (I didn't even like\nthe performance from Chl\u00f6e Grace Moretz, who I consider as one of the\nbest contemporary actresses). I think that any episode of the series\nColony has better ideas and more interesting drama about the\nextraterrestrial invasion. As usual, the TV saves the day.\n"

Last time this\nkind of thing happened, we got such forgettable films like \"Vampire\nAcademy\" and \"City of Ember,\" films that basically seemed to think they\ncould scrape by on their name-recognition that they could, in turn,\ncover-up their own mediocrity. Now, however, the industry finds itself\nin more dire straights, so it only seemed right that Rick Yancey's\nnovel \"The 5th Wave,\" the first of a trilogy, would find itself blown\nup on the big screen sooner or later."

The only problem with that subtext is that in\nreality life is getting downright screwed up for plenty of people these\ndays even if there is no alien invasion coming at any time soon. The\npremise for making movies like this is that this type of SF is \"good\nhonest escapism\" but I think that disastrous scenarios for Earth are\nnot just the stuff of SF. There is no significant number of electric\ncars on the road today (even after the idea that relying on oil for\nenergy is bad for Earth's atmosphere has long been established) and\nwe-as a society-are still virtually completely dependent on big oil as\nour main source of fuel for our vehicles and the thing that balances\nour economy also. And woe betide anyone who says using so much oil is\ndumb especially since we can use electricity to power vehicles cleaner\n& cheaper. Films like this are \"reassuring\" to people because it's all\n'just a story.' Maybe big oil is run by aliens. The acting in the film\nwas predictably fair to good and the special effects were predictably\nminimal. There were exactly three other people in a cinema that could\neasily accommodate about 300 people when I saw this film on a weekend\nmatin\u00e9e showing in the early afternoon. Apparently people also don't go\nto the movies on the weekend anymore either.\n"

I'm really becoming a fan of hers and I'm sure to be\nseeing a lot more of her in upcoming movies. I don't think they'll make\na sequel to this one, but I'm sure the next role will be even better.\nNick Robinson does a decent job. Again, I think he has a very promising\ncareer in front of him and we'll be seeing him in a lot more movies.\nHere come the spoilers, so you may not want to read the rest. Movies\nneed to do a better job of editing. It is becoming too obvious that\nscenes are filmed in tiny spaces and then they try to make it look like\na larger space, but it isn't working. 2 spots where terrible for this:\nthe gun fight in the ally and when the family 1st sees the spaceship.\nAdditionally, I'm getting a little tired with the story line that 2 or\n3 people can infiltrate a completely manned army base. Come on. It is\njust too ridiculous. Throw some of those ideas out and it isn't a bad\nmovie, but it isn't a great movie either.\n"

While I\npictured Ben Parish, Evan Walker, Sam, Teacup, and Ringer quite\ndifferent from the actors who played them I did enjoy the characters\nthemselves, if I separate what I know from the book at least. If you\nare looking for a movie without sexual content, this one is good. Aside\nfrom sexual comments and a kissing scene there isn't anything to worry\nabout if you plan to watch with children. The violence isn't to much as\nwell even though it is an action film with a sci-fi twist. The movie\nwas quite similar to the movie The Host though. The alien twist and how\nthe children are part of the fifth wave was my favorite part of the\nentire movie and the book.\n"

Four years after the\nlast \"Twilight\" film, the year after the \"Hunger Games\" series ended\nand the year before the \"Divergent\" and \"Maze Runner\" franchises finish\nshowing teens how to survive the end of the world, 2016 gives us \"The\n5th Wave\" (PG-13, 1:52). Based on Rick Yancey's 2013 novel of the same\nname, \"The 5th Wave\" has taken its place as the 5th major YA movie\nseries of the new millennium, and utilizes elements of the previous\nfour. This film has the love triangle of \"Twilight\" and \"The Hunger\nGames\", the \"I gotta be me\" sensibility of \"Twilight\" and \"The\nDivergent Series\", the \"don't look behind the curtain\" plot line of the\nlast three of those film series and the \"girl power\" element of the\nfirst three. Lastly, as USA Today's review of the book states, \"The 5th\nWave\" does \"for aliens what 'Twilight' did for vampires.\" Of course,\nborrowing from previous stories doesn't mean that this one isn't\noriginal, or good."

                "reviews": "\nThe new installment to the Kung Fu Panda franchise, which might be the\nlast we see of our fury friend, thus capping off the trilogy. While\nKung Fu Panda 3 is certainly enjoyable and kids will like it, there are\ncertain elements it didn't take away from the previous movie, and one\nof its main struggles is this one seemed more like a kids movie than\nthe other previous two, as the first two had certain elements that made\nit more enjoyable for adults. The message in this movie is pretty good\nfor kids, but the way they go about displaying isn't as good as the\nfirst two. I am a huge fan of Kung Fu Panda 2(and Dreamworks in\ngeneral), and what works well in that movie is the darker tone it\ntakes, as well as the message that we have to accept our dark pasts.\nAnyway back to KP3, the voice acting is superb, the action is actually\nreally great at times, and while it does seem to run the series full\ncircle it isn't better than its predecessors. Again great movie to take\nyour kid to for a fun time, especially for an animated movie in\nJanuary(I'm looking at you Norm of the North)\n"

The villain was REALLY well\nanimated and his design ROCKED. The art direction was simply stunning\nand the movie was the perfect balance of thrilling kung fu action and\nsilly comedy. Ever time it felt like the tone could be getting too\nserious and dark,, it would lighten right back up again and make you\nlaugh - not in a trite way, but in a way that felt really suited to the\ntone of the Panda movies. My 4 year old daughter loved it and even my\nson, at 17 mos old, who kept getting tired of sitting still, would\ncontinually get pulled back into the movie by the awesome action. After\nthe movie, the kids WERE Kung fu pandas for quite a while, it was\nadorable. GO SEE this movie!! I am sure we will see it again. I also\nLOVED the use of the Imagine Dragon's song \"I'm so sorry\" as Kai's\ntheme.. its totally baddass and PERFECT for a Kung fu villain. loved\nit. go see it.\n"

                "reviews": "\nSo far this film completes a very fun and very solidly made franchise\nthat will go nicely with my Kung Fu Panda collection. DreamWorks really\nimpressed me with this one. Proving that Shrek the Third was just a\nhiccup (no pun intended). And I love it when I struggle to say which\nfilm is the best out of the franchise, that means they made a great\nfranchise. One thing that DreamWorks knows how to do is keep you\nguessing. People always assume the film is going to do badly but\nactually ends up hitting a home run, this is no exception. If\nDreamWorks keeps this up, they can overrun Pixar as they are going\nthrough a weak time right now with the exception of Inside Out.\nDreamWorks continues to impress with year after year of good to great\nfilms. Heck I think Home is better then Cars 2. Now what stands out\nabout the film itself is it isn't afraid to take chances. And more\ntimes then not actually ends up paying off. The voice talent is well,\ntalented. Each character whether its returning ones or new ones each of\nthem does a marvelous job. Bryan Cranston, Kate Hudson, and especially\nJ.K. Simmons who literally blends into the character. I couldn't\nimagine him talking behind the microphone because he didn't use his\nactual voice rather made the character his. The negatives I have is\nthat it doesn't spend time with the characters we've come to enjoy.\nTigress even though she was in it more then the other Furious Fives,\nbut I still would like to see her in action more then they did. They\ncompletely shun the other characters like Viper, Mantis, Crane, and\nMonkey. They sort of pushed them aside and made room for the newer\ncharacters. Which is fine, but after coming to know and love these\ncharacters especially Tigress, I would liked to have seen more from\nthem. Also, the story seems overdone especially the villain. Even\nthough I like J.K. Simmons as the character, the character himself is\njust Ti Lung all over again (sorry if I misspelled his name). And is\nthe third time a villain has underestimated Po with the same question,\n\"Is he the one destined to stop me?\" Or something along those lines.\nBut despite those mistakes the film makes up in shire courage.\nDreamWorks could have easily been lazy and made this another Shrek the\nThird, but thank heavens it wasn't that. I had a lot of fun watching\nthis as a full grown adult, so kids should have a blast with this film.\nLike in DreamWorks fashion this is a film worthy of the entire family\nand you deserve it so you can get the bad taste of Norm of the North\nout of your mouths. This is how animated film are meant to be.\nDreamWorks proves they are still one of the best in the business, maybe\nthe best right now. Check it out, you will regret it if you don't. Now\nto grade: Animation: A+ Characters: A Voice Acting: A Story: B+ Risk\nValue: A+ Music: A- (Best score by Hans Zimmer in a long time.)\nOverall: A\n"

Regardless of your\npolitical affiliation, if you have any thoughts about what happened at\nBenghazi, you need to see this movie. Michael Bay does a great job of\nportraying what happened. Additionally, with the exception of one\nindividual who s portrayed as not wanting to take action, he does not\ntake the obvious opportunity to lay blame at any single individual in\nthe US government. He clearly portrays a small group of men as heroes.\nWithout their courage and willingness to fight against what appears to\nbe an overwhelming force many more lives would have been lost. I do not\noften see movies twice, but this movie is likely to be an exception...\nIn closing, if Michael Bay is 90% accurate in his depiction of what\nhappened, our government (the US government), owes a huge debt of\ngratitude and an apology for their lack of action to 6 very brave men.\n"

This is a rare film in that I will want to\nsee again. I hope this work can help heal a country that was stabbed in\nthe gut by the attempt to muddle the facts from that day.\n"

It is basically them\ntrying to fight and figure out how they're going to escape from their\ncompound, which is being attacked, and return home to America. John\nKrasinski plays the main character, and he proves that he can become\nmore than just the pretty boy from The Office, as he gives a very\nstellar performance. The rest of the cast does well too. However, the\nmovie does suffer from jokes that you would find in the Transformers\nmovies, the kind that are childish and comes off as awkward. Also, some\nof the camera work can be unbelievably shaky at the beginning, although\nfor some reason, it's not like that throughout the entire movie.\nAction-wise, this movie has some very intense sequences that will make\nyou wonder if they are going to make it or not. Their may be a little\nbit too many explosions (how do those civilians have so many RPGs???),\nbut the direction is well- put together, I have to give Michael Bay\ncredit for this attempt.

And dates and\nplaces were not able to fascinate me. Luckily I was also an avid reader\nof fiction and reading historical novels made the events of the past so\nmuch more real . So to this day I have a tendency to look at historical\nevents through the interpretation of artists, be it writers, painters,\nmusicians or directors of movies. The older you get the more you\nrealize that even events which happen during your life time and\nsometimes just around the corner from you are being interpreted in so\nmany different ways, that at the end nobody really knows what happened.\nThe attack in Benghazi certainly falls into this category. So\npolitically charged and obfuscated, what was really going on? So I went\nto see the movie. First of all the movie was filmed in Malta not in\nLibya, I have been to Malta not to Libya and while there are\nsimilarities, they are not the same. The movie posed more questions\nthan answers for me. Why was there so little security for the compound\nof the ambassador? Why did the official refused to send help? Why were\nthese highly paid security contractors not used to help? Why did\nTripoli refuse to send help? Why did the American base in Italy or\nSpain did not send help? All these places were not far away? I read\nsomewhere that these American bases took 15 hours before they were able\nto dispatch somebody??? Why do the Libyan hate the Americans so much?\nObviously big failure all around,from the state department to the\npentagon and from some bureaucrats. So we are left with a handful of\nmacho super warriors, who finally get permission, to fight hundreds of\nterrorists and that is the movie. We see this story in American war\nmovies over and over again The super heroes who dodge all bullets while\neverybody else dies , they keep their sense of humor in even the most\nvolatile situation and come out okay at the other end. Well, not\neverybody came out okay at the end and the film did a good job showing\nthe humanity of those whose job is to kill and to be tough. So leaving\nthe movie I was as knowledgeable as I was before. I do not know what\nhappened I do not know what is being disguised from us and what orders\nhave been issued to those who were there to shut up. I am glad to know\nthat the surviving members of the warriors resigned and are pursuing a\nless dangerous life. Would I recommend that movie? Yes, I thought it\nwas interesting but do not think that you know what happened afterward.\n"

John Krasinski (\"The Office\") joins his fellow soldiers (James\nBadge Dale, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman \"Parenthood,\" Dominic Fumusa\n\"Nurse Jackie,\" and Max Martine) and others as they are charged with\nprotecting their compounds and rescuing Stevens. Each actor, along with\nthe always great-to-hate character actor David Costabile (\"Suits\"), are\nexcellent in their respective gritty roles, with Krasinski successfully\nstepping outside of his \"The Office\" role. Bay knows rock'm sock'm film\nmaking, and it all comes in handy here. Unfortunately, he is one of\nthose directors who feels an up close, constantly moving camera is the\nbest way to get his point across. Because of this style of filmmaking,\nmuch of the action is in blur. However, when he backs the camera away,\nallowing the audience to take in the surroundings, the result builds\ntension beyond belief. The \"Hillary\" effect isn't addressed here, so no\nneed to beat a dead horse. Realistic writing by Chuck Hogan, and\nscreenplay by Mitchell Zuckoff, keep the audience glued to the screen,\naction and storyline. From the film, and what we know from the news,\nsomething went seriously wrong in the communication in Libya, forcing\nour soldiers to step up and do what they do best - survive!

First of all, the stunts\nand action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max\nRockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as\nFuriosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his\nwives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max,\nwho has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior\nFuriosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and\nneither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against\nthem reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase\nfor the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the\nevils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers \"really skin coloured\" guy,\nwho works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays\noff, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action\nmovies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite\nmasterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action\nmovies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a\nmastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my\nexpectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark\ncomedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot.\nMust watch, and worth the extra IMAX 3D ticket.\n"

It has been 30 years since the\nrelease of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decided\nto return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he\ntruly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an\naction film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going to\nbe hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller\ndidn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous\nfilms. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new\nbackdrop for post- apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is an\nexhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating\nwhat might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing\nthat nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew\nme away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent\nfireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015\nvigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to\nreignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome of\nthe action genre.\n"

Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing,\ngathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the\naudience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and\nexhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage\nwithin the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is\nhorrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell\nyou, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride.\nIt's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world\nand all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt\nunder your seat."

Seriously! #30 in the Top#250 !? Are you all\nkidding me?1 This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a\nvery very long time! I love action movies, so this is not coming from a\n\"The Notebook\" kind of guy, but seriously, there is nothing nothing\ngood about this movie, it's borderline (if not full-on) ridiculous! A\nchained guy playing a flame throwing guitar?! Does it look cool? Yes,\nbut in a very joke-like kind of way, they seriously can't expect to be\ntaken seriously, or expect anyone to think that in whatever\npost-apocalyptic scenario the world turns to, that is ever going to\nhappen, so it is obviously to be taken as a joke, pretty much like 50%\nof the whole movie! Ohhh and talking about 50% of the whole movie,\nyeah, where did that go? Cos I could swear that they played the movie\nhalf-way through, and then just rewinded it back to the beginning. What\na stupid movie! They spend half to movie trying to get somewhere, and\nwhen they get there (only to be greeted by the bad ass granny's, again,\nnot ridiculous at all) they come to the conclusion that they have to go\nback to where they came from, and you get to see THE EXACT same stuff\nyou had just seen 30 minutes before. What a pathetic excuse for a\nmovie, I mean, half a movie. There is not even an attempt of a\nstoryline! ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will\ntry and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no\npauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline...\nwhat storyline?! Save yourself $10 and here is for you the whole movie,\nSilent Max (Hardy)(definitely not MAD) appears on screen and tells us\nabout his bad ass life in this post-apocalyptic world. I wonder how he\nsurvived this far, since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and\ntaken to this Badguys Headquarter Mountians where he is to be drained\nof his blood to feed some even weirder baddies (Hoult). Then, Furiosa\n(Theron) is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw\nRuler, Immortal Joe and flees with his pet girlfriends, so ALL of the\nbad guys in the WHOLE WORLD, decide to chase them. They spend half the\nmovie running from them, in this busted down truck always dragging with\nthem this HUGE ASS semi-trailer that apparently is filled with breast\nmilk (mothers milk?)! Seriously? They get stuck in mud and all sorts of\ndisasters, but GOD forbid they would ever just, unhook the\nsemi-trailer, for whatever reason that is. They finally get to where\nthey are going, to be greeted by 80 year old Amazon fighters! LOL, that\nsomehow have survived for soo long is this God Forsaken world. They\ntell Furiosa, that the GreenLands are gone, so they decided to go back\nto where they came from, since all the baddies were on the road chasing\nthem, and there was no one left holding the fort. So they start making\nthey're way back, through all the baddies again, on her way back to\nwhere they were in the beginning of the movie. In the return sector,\nyou see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first\nhalf. The get there, with the dead body of Immortal Joe (yep, he died.)\nand become the ruler (I guess) of these Mountains that miraculously has\ntons of water, that no one has any clue where it comes from. Max\nleaves! The Pathetic End!\n"

Mad Mad and the Road Warrior this one is not.\nIt's interesting, fascinating even, but it is nothing more than a\nparody, and Miller and the rest are all too aware of this. In the first\n3 film, we get to suspend disbelief, and enter into a post-apocalyptic\nworld, with anthropological and sociological element we could believe\nin, that is simply just missing from this re-boot. That to me is\nunforgivable. Mad Max and The Road Warrior were convincing in it's\ntribalism, brutality and uncompromising violence. One gets the\nimpression society would devolve into this. And the Lord of the Flies\nthemes in the 3rd one, despite Tina Turner, brilliant. But massive dune\nbuggies, rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman? No way.\nMiller, you messed up bad. The only thing you got right was Max, a\n\"shell of a man\" who hasn't quite lost his humanity, only long\nforgotten and buried it.

I have not watched the original Mad Max with Mel\nGibson. Therefore, I cannot condemn the whole series, I will only be\njudging this movie. 3. I L-O-V-E adventure/fantasy/dystopian movies!!!\nI'm literally a junkie, I have watched pretty much every one out there.\nSo I am not a hater of the genre. That being said, I will continue with\nmy first, genuine reaction to this film in quotes: \" What the f..* did\nI just watch. These are 120 minutes of my life that I will NEVER, EVER\nGET BACK!!! Thank the lord I didn't go to the movies to watch it with\nmy friends when they asked me to, 'cause apart from my time, I'd also\nbe crying over my money now!\" Yes, in my non- professional opinion as a\nhumble viewer, this piece of sh..* that I wasted my time watching was\nabsolutely horrific. What do I even start with? The absolutely\nridiculous , non-existent plot?A stupid bunch consisting of a lunatic,\na bald chief on the verge of schizophrenia and a few hot girls, just\nbecause, decide to run off to the sunset to find a non-existent promise\nland and are chased by another crazy bunch of ugly beasts and\nbrainwashed slaves for absolutely no freaking reason. Oh, and as if\nthat was not stupid enough, half way the decide they were wrong and\nturn the F..* AROUND!!! So they continue being chased by the same\nidiots who end up not catching them after all and then they\nrelease....water...and they all live happily ever after!!! Hooray!!!!\nWTF????!!! If there was some interest in the history and setting of\nthis dystopian world it eluded me , since no one freaking bothered to\nexplore it a little further. All we get is that these people are pretty\nmuch dying of thirst due to a lack of water, but every time their ugly\nleader wakes up in a good mood he releases a freaking waterfall and\nwastes half their water supplies by spilling it all over the place. Not\nto mention this literally MAD Max character, who decides to pretty much\nhave himself killed in a ruthless road trip- gone-bad even though he\ndoesn't really give a sh..*! Why on earth (other than the obvious\nreason of earning some shamefull but necessary money)would wonderful\nactors like Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy (whom I don't particularly\nlove, but in all honesty I haven't exactly followed so far in his\ncareer) agree to be part of this sh..* excuse of a film, I have no\nidea. All I can say, is that it took me three days to watch the damn\nthing, because I was so freaking bored that I 'd literally stop it\nevery 15 minutes or so to go find something interesting to do with my\nlife. But I am a compulsive nerd who just had to finish what she\nstarted, so I went through 120 ENDLESS MINUTES OF TORTURE AND BOREDOM,\nonly to come out of it with so much anger that I had to come in here\nand write a review to release part of it and go to bed. So,DO NOT WATCH\nMAD MAX. DO NOT WATCH IT. Watch 50 shades of gray instead. It's a sh..*\nmovie as well, but if you happen to be a 50 year old pervert with 0\nlove life you might actually enjoy it more. Or better yet, go find\nsomething else to do with your life. Anything really. Reading the back\nlabel of your clothes detergent would be more educational, useful,\ninteresting AND entertaining. I give it a -10.\n"

According to THE FINEST HOURS, women think with\ntheir Hearts--NOT their Heads. Disney proves that if it were up to\nMiriam, the 32 survivors of the oil tanker Pendleton all would have\ndrowned. If THE FINEST HOURS bunch had made GONE WITH THE WIND, that\nyawner would have been 2 1/2 hours shorter, because Mrs. Lincoln would\nhave commanded Abe NOT to contest the Rebels or their Lazy Plantation\n\"Colonels'\" Racist Black Slavery System. (Of course, Mrs. Smith would\nbe too busy picking cotton nowadays to raise any Oscar ruckus, had\nwomen like Abe's Mary Todd and THE FINEST HOURS' Miriam been able to\nsuccessfully influence their men.) With its FINEST HOURS, Disney is\ntelling America NOT to be hasty in electing a Woman President. \"View\nTHIRTEEN HOURS first, America, before casting your ballots,\" might as\nwell be Disney's \"Tag-Line\" for THE FINEST HOURS.\n"

Emily Blunt is completely underutilized here; Her character\nmakes some of the stupidest decisions but, some of it is justified. All\nEmily Blunt really does in this movie is stumble upon things, makes\nstupid decisions, and smokes a ton of cigarettes. Benicio Del Toro is a\nbad-ass in this movie and his scenes are the most interesting, but Del\nToro's story isn't engaging enough because it is lacking what the rest\nof the movie is lacking... a story. Sicario plays more on beats, tone,\nimages, and simplicity rather than dramatic story elements and\nsentimental emotion. This movie is extremely blood soaked, violent, and\nsometimes haunting, but that's all it has going for it. This movie\nmeans nothing, it starts nowhere, and it ends nowhere. The movie is\n100% predictable minus a couple of moments with Del Toro towards the\nend. If you want to see a boring tension-filled blood-soaked horror\nfeast than enjoy. If you want to see an engaging and emotionally\ncharged character driven story (including all of the extreme\nblood-soaked horror violence) than pass on this one because it's not\npresent.\n"

                "reviews": "\nOf the nearly 400 films being showcased at this year's Toronto \r\nInternational Film Festival (TIFF), Denis Villeneuve's Sicario was the \r\none film at the top of my 'Must See' list. Having premiered at this \r\nyear's Cannes Film Festival where it went on to be nominated for the \r\nprestigious Palme D'Or, Sicario stars Emily Blunt, Joh Brolin and \r\nBenicio Del Toro as members of a government task force who attempt to \r\napprehend a villainous drug lord. \r\n\r\nDirector Denis Villeneuve is on some kind of roll. His previous films \u0096 \r\nPolytechnique, Incendies and Prisoners \u0096 were all thought provoking \r\ncharacter pieces offset by realistic and graphic depictions of \r\nviolence. Sicario opens with just such a scene as Blunt's Kate Macer \r\nleads a rain on a Mexican drug house near Phoenix, Arizona and \r\ndiscovers dozens of executed victims packed into the walls. Audiences \r\nwill have barely settled in their seats and scrunched on but a handful \r\nof popcorn kernels when the shocking revelation is revealed on screen. \r\n\r\nFrom here, Macer is forced to work with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and \r\nAlejandro (Del Toro) who works as a sort of fixer on both sides of the \r\nborder. Their work leads them to drug trafficker Fausto (Julio Cesar \r\nCedillo) and the group then works to transport the criminal back across \r\nthe border. Their journey will be met with many obstacles with \r\nshoot-outs at border crossings and a tense hunt and shoot inside a drug \r\ntrafficking tunnel connecting the two countries. \r\n\r\nThe focus of Sicario (which is Mexican slang for 'hitman') is clearly \r\non Blunt's lead character and Blunt is up to the task in being the \r\nsmartest person in the room while also being the one most left in the \r\ndark as to the team's objectives. She will be continually conflicted by \r\nher male peers particularly their penchant for instigating or \r\nresponding forcefully to appeared violence. The action settled between \r\nMacer's first-hand education thrust the film forward to a very \r\nsatisfying and acceptable conclusion. \r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is equally engrossing particularly Del Toro who \r\nwill be on screen for most all of the film's most memorable shots. Del \r\nToro's character is clouded in mystery and unclear motives and Del Toro \r\ngives his best performance since Traffic.\r\n\r\nSicario was penned by Taylor Sheridan who played Deputy Chief Hale on \r\nFX's Sons of Anarchy. His take on the war on drugs and the violence and \r\nhuman costs that surround the battle are dead on target. The realism \r\nresults in Sicario being hardly the crowd-pleaser. It is a bleak and \r\ngrim film that might just be Villeneuve's best work to date. \r\n\r\nThe photography by Roger Deakins is stunning. Expect Deakins to garnish \r\nanother Academy Award nomination for his efforts here to go with his \r\nwork on The Shawshank Redemption and Skyfall. \r\n\r\nAlso worthy of note is the music by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson that grabs you by \r\nthe balls while the action unfolds. \r\n\r\nSicario might be too bleak for Academy voters, but make no mistake of \r\nSicario's impact and brilliance. It was on my 'Must See' list for a \r\nreason and did not disappoint. Easily the best film of the year so far.\r\n\r\n\n"

On the technical side, it was\nperfectly filmed, has appropriate sound effects and the soundtrack\nincreases the tension of the whole movie.

What are we\nwilling to allow in order to stop the drug culture? Or at least impede\nit? The characters involved are great, the point of view for the\naudience is basically that of the FBI agent who doesn't really\nunderstand the real face of the conflict. The audience is slowly let in\non just what elements of the US government are doing and why, with the\nthe main character having the same reservations and asking the same\nquestions we, as the audience, want to ask.

                "reviews": "\nI saw the poster for this film on the side of bus, the three leading\ncast members certainly appealed to me, and the title that I did not\nunderstand the meaning of, I saw it was getting great reviews, so I\nwent to see it, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners). Basically\nidealistic FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams agent Kate Macer\n(Emily Blunt) and her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) survive an\nexplosion in Chandler, Arizona, following the discovery of dozens of\ncorpses within the walls of a house. Kate's boss Dave Jennings\n(Titanic's Victor Garber) recommends her to undercover CIA Special\nActivities Division officer Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who enlists her\nto aid in finding those responsible for the bomb that killed two\nofficers. Kate is partnered with enigmatic consultant Alejandro\n(Benicio Del Toro), who has a questionable past, she thought they were\ntravelling to El Paso, Texas, in fact they arrive in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico,\nand the mission is to crack down on the escalating drugs war, and\nspecifically to capture or kill cartel boss Manuel D\u00edaz (Bernardo P.\nSaracino). At one point the transportation vehicles the officers are\ntravelling in are caught in traffic, this is in fact some some of prior\ngathering of cartel members, Kate is appalled by the attack on these\ncriminals, with no regard for the safety of civilians in their\nvehicles. Matt and his team are interested in finding D\u00edaz's boss, drug\nlord Fausto Alarc\u00f3n (Julio Cedillo), they target money launderers, Kate\nis ignored for believing she could be close to making an arrest on\nD\u00edaz, and the situation gets worse when she recognises local cop Ted\n(Jon Bernthal) is wearing the same rubber wristband as a money\nlaunderer, he is one of many cops, that he names in interrogation,\nworking for D\u00edaz. On a night that Matt and his team plan to follow\nD\u00edaz, using distraction, Mexican police officer Silvio (Maximiliano\nHern\u00e1ndez) is kidnapped by Alejandro, suspecting something Kate goes\nagainst orders and follows Alejandro, escaping his attempt to kill her\nshe demands answers from Matt, he says that their goal is to restore\npower to the Colombian Medell\u00edn Cartel, this is apparently the best\nhope for the U.S. Alejandro and Silvio manage to catch up with D\u00edaz,\nSilvio is killed by Alejandro and he kills D\u00edaz at Alarc\u00f3n's estate, it\nwas Alarc\u00f3n that brutally killed his wife and daughter, Alejandro kills\nthe drug lord's wife and two sons so he can experience the same loss he\ndid, before he finally kills him. Alejandro returns and Kate is ashamed\nand dishonoured by his actions, she refuses to sign a waiver stating\nthat everything they did was \"by the book\", but she does so when her\nown gun is put to her head, Kate initially then points the gun at\nAlejandro, but she stops herself, lowers her gun and allows him to walk\naway. Also starring Daniel Kaluuya as Reggie Wayne, Jeffrey Donovan as\nSteve Forsing, Raoul Trujillo as Rafael and Lora Martinez-Cunningham as\nJacinta. To be completely, despite great performances by always\nreliable Blunt, the interesting Del Toro and decent Brolin, I found\nthis film a bit complicated most of the time, I don't know if it was\ntoo political, or I was just generally confused. I understood the main\ncharacter being caught in situations she did not expect, and the title\n\"sicario\" means \"hitman\" in Spanish, but I could only just follow the\naction, I was however gripped by the gun-filled and explosive moments,\noverall I can't fully agree with five stars out of five that critics\ngive it, but I did like it, it's a worthwhile crime thriller. Good, in\nmy opinion!\n"

First off, for me this\nmovie was a great way to get to know for the first time two big names\nand talents in the industry: lead actor Benicio Del Toro and director\nDenis Villeneuve. The former did an outstanding job -maybe Oscar\nworthy, totally nomination worthy- at portraying a cold and expert man\n(I won't get into detail not to spoil anything), the latter made great\nuse of the south-US/Mexico landscapes, but also of the focus on small\ndetails, to give a proper identity to the film, which eventually looks\nslick and classy while also portraying horrifying images (i.e. the\namazing first scene). I also liked Josh Brolin's take as an eccentric,\nno-nonsense DoD consultant, though his character tended to turn darker\nand darker for no apparent reason. Probably (hopefully) he's gonna have\na big role in the sequel. J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson keeps up the good work with\na simple, yet fitting soundtrack: he reminds me more and more of the\nmastermind, Hans Zimmer, in that sense. But let's get to the nay part.\nBefore watching \"Sicario\" I'd heard that Emily Blunt's performance was\nthe one to look after. It isn't. She really tries, and she does so hard\nshe gets irritating. She's always swearing, crying, being disappointed,\nand all that in a desperate way, as if she needed to show us she's the\nlead actress in a boys' flick. Her partner does the same, or even\nworse. Finally, some words on the complicated plot. At the end of the\nstory, everything fits well, and you won't be disappointed, but in the\nmaking it feels at times disorienting and excessively cryptic."

Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force\nupon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible\naction-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject\nmatter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and\nturn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch\nespecially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and\nit really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for\nold men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet\nopposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds.\nDel toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best\nperformance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner\nscene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.\n"

                "reviews": "\nHow far we should go in prosecuting the drug war is the main concern of\nSICARIO, the latest directorial effort by Denis Villeneuve. The\nviolence brought about by America's war on drugs is a sensitive one\nbecause of the complex motives and casualties on both sides. This film\ndoesn't really offer any answers, but it does provide enough to\nmentally chew on as the morally gray areas inherent in such an effort\nare explored. The audience's surrogate is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI\nagent who volunteers for an inter-agency task force that takes her into\nthe heart of Mexico with the goal of finding a top boss in the cartel.\nAlong for the mission is a mysterious person, Alejandro (Benicio del\nToro), whose allegiance and motives are unclear (at first). If there's\none weakness in the film, it's Emily Blunt's character, unfortunately.\nWhile she and her FBI partner provide the bulk of the dramatic\nconflict, she never really develops satisfactorily, instead relegated\nto a mostly passive observer. Benicio del Toro's character is by far\nthe most interesting and compelling, and he get most of the best\nmoments and dialogue. From a technical standpoint, SICARIO compares\nwell with Villeneuve's other work and features outstanding\ncinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins (who also worked on\nPRISONERS). Slow and deliberate camera-work nicely complements the\nslow-burn pacing, which culminates in one of the tensest (and morally\nambiguous) scenes in recent memory. If there's one thing that this film\ndoes extremely well, it shows that the drug war has far-reaching\neffects from the top of the food chain down to a cop who is just trying\nto provide for his family (even if it is on the wrong side of the law).\nI should also mention the excellent score by Johann Johannsson,\nalthough a key element of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's style. If\nI had seen this last year, it most certainly would have made my top\nten. As it stands, it further establishes Denis Villeneuve as a talent\nto be reckoned with and is suitably entertaining to boot.\n"

People were either moved by it or repulsed. I had\nto see why. From the very first scene, I was drawn in. Having a\nperipheral involvement in law enforcement myself, I had more than a\npassing interest in this movie. I was not disappointed!!! Unlike many,\nI see the necessity of unconventional methods to stem the flow of drugs\nand to halt the violence created by it. This movie very graphically\nportrayed the nightmare that is Juarez, Mexico and its effect on the\nUS. The acting of Del Toro, Brolin, Blunt and Kaluuya brought it all\nhome in a very real way but I honestly think the first star of this\nmovie was the cinematography. These images brought home by the type of\nphotography used was pulse pounding and seemed as real as life itself.\nI was riveted to this movie from scene one not wanting to miss a\nmoment. The soundtrack, subdued and VERY dark, fit the movie perfectly.\nI've rarely seen a movie this good! I highly recommend it!!!!!\n"

                "reviews": "\nSpectre is one of the best Bond films yet.. It's up there with Skyfall\nand Goldfinger. The movie featured a little more romance than the\nusual. The cinematography and the music score for this film really made\nthe scenes grip the viewer. It was an interesting take to have Bond's\nadopted brother be the villain. It made the plot a lot darker and the\nfact that he described himself as the \"author of all your pain\",\nimplied that this man was a way bigger threat, because he most likely\nhad been sabotaging things for years. The last scene with the booby\ntraps and the girl in danger was a little clich\u00e9, but it was nice to\nsee how much thought went into it. Whether it was CGI or makeup, the\nantagonist looked spooky with the missing eye. With the combination of\nall the camera surveillance and the immense knowledge the enemy group\nhad on James Bond, this is one of the few films that really makes the\naudience fear for him. It's a nonstop ride from start to finish with a\nlittle humor, and just enough back story to make the people care. WELL\nDONE.\n"

                "reviews": "\nLet's be honest, here. The dead is indeed alive. It's nice to see the\nwords, Spectre come back from the dead, after a 40 year absence from\nthe franchise. It has been way too long. The reason for this, is that\nwhen 1961's novel 'Thunderball', was being made; original James Bond\nauthor, Ian Fleming opt for some help from his friends, such as\nscreenwriter, Kevin McClory & some others to make a film version of it.\nOnly to screw them from writing credit, when the film script version\nwas completed in 1964. This lead, to a long legal battle, between\nMcClory & Fleming, until McClory won out, in 1976; retained the filming\nrights of the novel. With that deal, came the lost, at least ten\nprevious own literary properties & titles. One of them, happen to be\nthe Spectre Organization in which, James Bond fight against in the\nnovel, Thunderball. Once, considered as a future James Bond title in\nthe 1960s & 1980s, Spectre wasn't made into a movie, until November\n2013, when Eon Production and McClory's estate formally settled the\nissue. This allow, MGM, Eon Production's mother company to acquire the\nfull copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the\ncharacters associated with. Still, the production for this film was\ntroublesome. First off, the movie went, highly over-budget, and\nover-schedule. Many of these problems, came from the fact, that Sony\ndemanded rewrites after a 2014 email hack. They really want to cover\nup, and recon the leak spoilers, even beyond when filming started. This\ncause, the movie to have a very incredibly underwhelming and at times,\nnonsensical third act. I have to say, its shows. The main plot of James\nBond (Daniel Craig) trying to unravel, a new terrorist organization,\ndoesn't match, well, with the sub-plot of M (Ralph Fiennes) trying to\nstop, his government from creating, a unified New World Order\nsurveillance network. It was very uneven. I also get that the movie\ntakes place 18 months, after the events of 2012's Skyfall, but it\nreally seem, like all the flaws that James Bond had, in the last movie,\nis non-existence in this film. It's really odd, how he can barely hit\nhis target in the last movie, and now, he's has the power of improbably\naiming skills. It's so jarring. What happen to all of his weaknesses?\nFor an action movie, this is probably, the weakest in the Daniel\nCraig's James Bond series of films. There are way too much, badly done,\nCGI effects. It's always stale, when we see the same, repetitive\naction. Most of all, lots of bad guys just standing around, talking and\nmaking idiotic decision making. Still, they did, get some hits on Bond.\nSad, the whole torturing scene isn't one of them. I didn't like the\nwhole, non-selling. It was a bit confusing on what the hell, was going\non! However, I do like the demolition scene that the villains plan.\nStill, the filming process must have been extremely miserable for both\nthe returning director, Sam Mendes & main actor, Daniel Craig. There\nhas been times, when, Craig had joked that he would rather slit his\nwrists than play 007 again, and Mendes threating to leave, the\nproduction. However, I guess, cooler heads prevails, because they were\nable to pull, the movie, off. It was far from being a total disaster!\nIn my opinion, the movie that has James Bond's first encounter with the\nglobal criminal organization, Spectre, since 1971's Diamonds Are\nForever was mostly alright to me. I have only a few problems with it.\nFirst off, the movie length. It's a really strained watch. Since, the\nmovie does have some slow & often clich\u00e9s parts, you really feel, the\nlong runtime. Still, the movie does have a lot more, humor than the\nprevious Daniel Craig's films. I like, how the writers were a lot more\nopen to a lot of old school Bond mannerism. It's nice to see that side\nof Bond, again. Also, I do love the cool references to the older films.\nGreat homages. I also like, how Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) & Q (Ben\nWhishaw) are given, more to do, than minor background characters. Some\nof the best scenes, are with those characters. However, this movie is\nmissing the emotional drive. The chemistry between Bond and his main\nlove-interest, Dr. Madeleine Swann (L\u00e9a Seydoux) is questionable at\nbest, due to the age different. I really found, their love-affair,\nkinda forced. While Seydoux was alright as eye-candy. Her acting, not\nso much. Her French accent is a little distracting. I kinda wish, the\nminor, bond girl, that Monica Bellucci plays, had a bigger role in the\nplot. After all, Daniel Craig indeed love, working with her, the most.\nShe might be 50, but she's still gorgeous. Christoph Waltz as the\nvillain, Franz Oberhauser AKA Ernst Stavro Blofeld did a great job at\nbeing the charming host/criminal psychopath. I also didn't mind, Dave\nBatista's minor role as the henchmen. However, I kinda, wish, he had\nmore lines. There was a lot of grief over Sam Smith's new Bond song:\n\"Writing on the Wall, but it sounded grand and a fitting Bond song over\nthe credits. It's not amazing, but sure it's better than a lot of other\nrecent efforts like Madonna. I just didn't like the weird octopus porn\nopening, but I did dig, the D\u00eda de los Muertos opening with Thomas\nNewman's score. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema did ensures that\nMexico City are never less than ravishing. Don't care, if they got\ntaxation benefits, because of that, but I didn't, how the movie travels\nfrom one exotic location to another. It was too much! Too hard to keep,\ntrack of it. Overall: While, it fails to pack the emotional punch.\nSpectre is 007 out of 10. It's still worth seeing.\n"

                "reviews": "\nSkyfall changed the way we saw Jame Bond. The gadgets were stripped,\ncheesy one- liners thrown out the window, and a light hearted attitude\nwas pushed aside for serious one. Craig's Bond means business,\nespecially when things were personal. Spectre follows this by being an\nindirect sequel to Casino Royale, Quantum and Skyfall. It ties up ends\nthat don't necessarily need tying up. If, like me, you love a bit of\nnostalgia in movies, you'll point out things and get overly excited.\nTrue Bond fans will be wanting more, but need not fear, Spectre's on\npar with its predecessor, just for different reasons. The opening scene\nis phenomenal. We follow a couple walking their way through the streets\nin Mexico City during Day of the Dead. Surely the most technical shot\nshould be saved for last. Craig is on top form, Christoph Waltz's\nvillain matching him blow by blow. Dave Bautista's henchman, similar to\nGoldfinger's Oddjob, is underused, whilst the Bond girls achieve what\nthey always achieve. Q (Wishaw) walks as much as he talks, and Judi\nDench is barely missed as Fiennes' M looks right at home with a\nsub-plot of his own. For every classic Bond forte there's a lack of\nanother, or an under-usage of it. Time is still shaping James Bond. 24\nfilms in and he's still full of surprises, just as Spectre has its own,\nassuming all forms of media have been avoided in your life.\n"

I had been wanting them\nto come back since Quantum of Solace kind of hinted they were lurking\nin the shadows. So it is with a bit of regret that the film was\nunderwhelming. Had the villains in the piece not been referred to as\nthe organization that plagued Bond's first six out of seven films and\nproduced so many cool villains, I may not of had the problems with the\nfilm I did. However, I just thought this film should have been a super\nawesome thrill ride that did not let up until the credits began to\nroll. It does not do this, not even close. Still, it was a good film\nand it seemed to mark Daniel Craig's last turn as Bond which would be\nkind of sad seeing as how it is set up so nicely now with Ralph Fiennes\nas M, a Q and a Moneypenny in place. I would hate for them to start\nover again, but I am afraid that is exactly what they will do as they\nintroduce yet another actor to play the role."

Bond's successfully\nfulfilled this unofficial mission after a breathtaking chase and fight\ninside helicopter in the air killed all his enemies.Bond also manage to\nsteal Sciarra ring with an octopus logo.Bond got suspended for his\naction even though M realize that this unofficial mission prevent the\nmass bombing scenario.But,he is not stopping at all, this is only the\nbeginning of his personal mission. Siaccra's death leads Bond to a\ngorgeous Italian widow Lucia Siaccra (Monica Belluci),and this gorgeous\nlonely that need a protector tips Bond about her late husband meeting\npoint. And Bond didn't need waste time and directly entered the meeting\npoint easily and finally not just see the face of Spectre's leader but\nsurprisingly this person has connection with Bond's childhood. Frankly\ni hope Spectre is going to be the greatest Bond ever made - better than\nSkyfall.But i must admit there are few things that i felt that should\nbe explore. When the leader of Spectre revealed himself to Bond, that\nreally shocked and i think scared the hell out Bond, is one of the best\nmomentum.When this Spectre mysterious leader Ernst Stavro Bloveld enter\nthe room, sudden this large meeting hall become so chill, filled with\nfear, we only hear his voice that gives the feel of terror.But this\nmomentum didn't maintained well. I think the story should explore more\n\"space\" for psychological battle between Bond and Ernst (a.k.a Franz\nOberhauser that believed is dead decades ago in an accident that also\nkilled Franz father). In Skyfall audiences were shown the psychological\ncondition between love and hatred of Raoul Silva (ex 00 agent went\nrough who seek revenge for being abandoned and left for dead after\nRaoul's personal mission almost jeopardize the handover Hongkong from\nEngland back to China back in 1997). Maybe that Sam Mendez already to\ntired to explore this psychological things.Or just wanna focus on\nBond's mission that really wanna put his misery to an end,cause Ernst\nrecognition that for this past few years Bond's misery for the lost all\nthat he love so much and devoted to is taken away by Ernst all along\nbehind his collaborator in crime. This is the most apparent weakness of\nthis Spectre. Craig performance is great, he can easily combined the\ndrama side of this Bond character. Monica Belluci short performance but\nstill can steal a few moments. I also give credit to Ben Whisaw as Q.\nand off course Waltz performance is good but not as strong as Javier's\nperformance as villain in Skyfall. But however the early of Waltz's\ncharacter appear is the best highlight in Spectre.\n"

It's still\na fun movie to sit through and personally, I just wasn't really bored\nwith it. Sure, some parts did seem slightly drawn out but for the most\npart it's a fun spy action movie. I can also see why some viewers might\ncompare this movie to \"Mission Impossible 5\". But this has a very\ndifferent vibe and different flare going for it, it is a James Bond\nmovie after all. As a matter of fact I enjoyed this movie as much as I\nenjoyed \"Mission Impossible 5\". The action sequences was cool and the\nfight between James Bond and Mr. Hinx was brutal and it's one of the\ntop one on one fight sequences I have seen that does not involve\nkung-fu. Mr. Hinx is like Nemesis from \"Resident Evil 3\" except he is\nhuman of course. However it's a movie that didn't seem to have a direct\nsense of direction sometimes and did seem inconherent few times, not as\nmuch as \"Quantum of Solace\" though. And it's a much better movie than\n\"Quatum of Solace\". The cinematography is also the best I have seen in\na Bond movie as well.

I speak particularly of\nMadeleine Swann, excellently played by Lea Seydoux. She balanced out\nBond so theta he wasn't quite so single minded and reckless as we've\nseen in other films, but he also retained that independence and\ndefiance that makes him 007. Ralph Fiennes does a spectacular job as M;\nit also makes for an interesting watch to see a more hands on M, one\nwho is also capable of being out in the field. Q, played by Ben\nWhishaw, delivered some cracking moments between him and Bknd that had\nthe audience in fits of laughter. Also, I must mention Christoph Waltz\nand Dave Bautista, both of whom bring the perfect measures of danger\nand thrill to the movie. Finally, Daniel Craig. People might say that\nhe's getting too old for the part but if you ask me he's at his prime.\nHe plays 007 so well, to the point where you don't realise he's playing\nhim, you just assume that Daniel Craig is James Bond. He brings a\npresence to the screen that is so powerful and individual you can't\nhelp but be glued to the movie every time he appears. Overall, this\nmovie deserves to do well because the brilliant acting, amazing\nstoryline, superb special effects, great theme song, the list goes on.\nIt's a return to form for James Bond. The whole cast can rest well\nknowing they've made another fantastic movie!!!\n"

Martin\nCampbell remains my favourite Bond film director (he not only gave us\ntwo of the best introduction films to new Bonds, Brosnan and Craig, in\nGoldeneye and Casino Royale, but two of the best Bond films, period)\nand I maintain that he should be brought back, as he's able to direct\naction in both thrilling and coherent ways.

It just didn't shed any light or interest! I did however\ndecide to see it with my Autistic brother (Nicholas). Two Autistic\nbrothers watching a James Bond film. Seems like a bonding if you ask\nme! The plot follows Skyfall exactly. Ever since M's death (Judi\nDench), Bond has never really been the same. Taking matters into his\nown hands. However, when a message from his past is revealed he decides\nto trace and follow the whole secret behind SPECTRE. It leads bond to\nthe man by the name of Blofeld. Blofeld is the man who is responsible\nfor everything that has happened to James Bond ever since \"Casino\nRoyale.\" The action is mind blowing to say the least! The first 10\nminutes involving a helicopter is truly breathtaking. Another scene\ninvolving an aeroplane is silly and over the top, and yet completely\nentertaining and mind blowing. Probably the best scene in the entire is\nBond's 2-3 minute on the train with Blofeld's henchman...Mr. Hinx. It\nwas also a reference to \"From Russia With Love.\" One of the best Bond\nfights we have had in a while."

This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into\ncinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected\nto perform better\u0097if not as well as the previous release\u0097it will not be\ntotally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a\nfeet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss\nWhedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations."

                "reviews": "\nThe second outing of Whedon's Avengers is bound to be compared to the\nfirst, but I cannot help but simply see this movie as a bridge between\nthe first and the third that is yet to come. Don't get me wrong, I\nloved this movie, but as is inevitable with ongoing series the middle\npart is a lot of continuation and no resolve. The opening dives\nstraight into the action without any prelude as to how the team have\nreassembled after the events of Iron Man 3, Cap 2 and Thor 2. The\naudience are left to assume that at some point between Iron Man 3 and\nthis movie Tony Stark decided to rebuild the Avengers after Shield went\ndown, thus donning his armour once more. With a few episodes of Angents\nof Shield still to air perhaps we will get a more thorough explanation\nbut for now one can only conclude that Stark was the driving force of\nthe idea and Cap the elected leader. The Maximoff twins are well\nexecuted away from the forbidden mutant element, the Avengers following\nCoulson's terminology of enhanced persons and dancing around the\npotential connection to the Inhumans that we may see in the future.\nWithout giving too much away I'll briefly touch on the romantic\nentanglements portrayed, the main twist meaning that many a\nBarton/Romanov shipper are to be disappointed. I however found the\ndevelopment of Barton's character to be endearing and by the end of the\nmovie was cheering on Hawkeye more than any other Avenger, now\ndesperate for a solo outing for the character (TV series anyone?). As\nfor Romanov, her romantic interest seems a bit forced and probably has\nmore to do with the chemistry between the actors than the characters.\nThere is a spark there no doubt but from a character standpoint it\nmakes little sense and seems to just serve to pull at our heartstrings\nlater on when the inevitable happens. It's a pleasure to see Paul\nBettany on screen at long last, his JARVIS becoming a fully formed\nVision and by films end becoming a New Avenger in his own right. The\nmyriad of cameos are enjoyable and thankfully purposeful as the end of\nthe movie sees the New Avengers forming out of this 'B-Team', hinting\nat the potential for Phase 4 of Marvel's plan as the current cast's\ncontracts start to run out. In conclusion, this movie is a wonderful\ncontinued romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe and leaves you\ndesperate for the next instalment and doesn't drop the ball, which as\nthe ninth movie in the series is an achievement in itself. Let the good\ntimes keep rolling!\n"

It's very much about action\nand entertainment, but there are also new characters to introduce, a\nblossoming love story between two Avengers to showcase, the infinity\ngems to gather quietly in the background, and a new villain to develop.\nWhile Whedon's wit and sharp writing are clearly very much an integral\npart of the film the humor doesn't seem quite as on the mark as it was\nin the first film. You simply just don't laugh as much during \"Age of\nUltron\" and that's a little disappointing."

Our way of living is a modern tale, our ego is of value. And\ntales, as they were used through all times in history, do emphasize on\na certain aspect. They offer a different view on real life\ncircumstances, we cant easily describe else. And this is what The\nAvengers does.

Serve and\nprotect. Love your next like your beloved brother. And you know this\nisn't easy, to keep the toilet clean with a brush after using it. So\nare the Avengers, they are always fighting on screen with uttermost\nforce. And they do cause tremendous havoc. But this is just the image\nof what is unseen in our real life.

Fighting every\nday for the good in this world, in all of us. A homage to you, as you\nwould never dare to show to anyone, even not yourself. No need to see a\nshrink anymore.

I heard many Ooos and\nAHss during the movie as well as laughter during the funny moments. I\nliked the movie not only for the obvious content but also for the many\nsurprises and \"Easter eggs\" spread around for the comic book fans. I\nwas very happy that the X-Mens Magnetos children, Scarlet Witch and\nQuicksilver were in it. Marvel was not allowed to call them mutants in\nthe movie by agreement with Fox studios. Their first appearance in the\ncomic books were in the Uncanny X-Men #4 back in 1963.I felt this was a\nfantastic move in the right direction for the marvel universe. Fans\neven got to see the high rise building under construction that was used\non the cover of the Fantastic Four # 26 when the FF teamed up with the\nAvengers to fight the Hulk. So, those seemingly small things put in by\nmarvel put in throughout the movie is the reason some critics rated the\nmovie average as opposed to those who rated it great; many people\nsimply did not understand what was going on in the plot or in the\nbackground, hence causing confusion and in some cases even\ndisappointment. Why does marvel do this? Because they are confident\ntelling their stories in their own way. And marvel of course, set up\nthe next Avengers movie by showing a villain a few minutes into the\nfinal credits. In closing, I recommend seeing this movie at the theater\nas soon as possible and maybe even watching it again at a later date to\nabsorb it all.\n"

There are numerous\nways that this movie could be reviewed. Compared to the first one, or\nas an individual movie itself. Generally second movies have always\nfallen prey to the sequel syndrome, where the hopes and expectations of\nthe film are let down; this is not that sequel. The movie itself is so\ngripping of excitement that one does not need to provide any spoilers\nto divulge just how breathtaking it will leave you, or more so excited.\nEach and every scene offers something new. Where the first movie was\nmore about how the Avengers come to be, this movie shows the mentality\nand development of each character and why they are who they are\nrespectively. The one thing that genuinely makes this film stand apart\nis the technology. Again, without spoiling, there are so many parts\nthat make this a world that can be, but has yet to happen. Alien\ntechnology aside, which is a hard thing when talking about the\nAvengers, the human tech has been beefed up in a very realistic and\nfuturistic way. Each and every fight scene gets better and better\nthroughout the movie, and the characters themselves make the movie. So\nmany laughs, so many twist, many where the action was less than a\nsecond beforehand, and you are still asking how and why, but there is\nno time to think. That is not an issue though, it all gets explained.\nThe cause for a 9 rating instead of a perfect 10 is that there are some\ngaps. Questions of how he or she got there so fast, almost making it\nlook like they teleported, but that was not the case. Overall, Avengers\nAge of Ultron is thus far the best action movie of 2015, and with\nrespects to Marvel, the best franchise movie yet. What the future holds\nfor Marvel has yet to be revealed, but there are clues. When the next\nmovie is released, the battle to save the earth, to save mankind, will\nneed more heroes than the ones that have already captivated the\ntheatrical world.\n"

Thats how you build a story, especially a super awesome one like\nthis. You don't just skip to the end. Its like people don't see what\namazing film making is done here. There's never been so many movies\nthat connect and every decision made affects another movie.Nobody\ncomplains about that with the hunger games or the harry potter series,\nbut guess what its the same thing.

The new characters were also well-received;\nparticularly Scarlet Witch, and it's nice to see another female added\nto an ensemble cast which is incredibly male-heavy.

That's\nexactly what happened in the TV Star Trek episode \"The Changeling\", in\nwhich a hokey looking computer named NOMAD became determined to destroy\nanything that didn't meet squarely with it's self appointed definition\nof perfection. If Captain Kirk were involved in this story, he might\nhave steered the Avengers to a plan that involved using logic to\ndemonstrate that blowing stuff up was not a perfect solution."

Not only does Diesel appear\nincredibly miscast as an immortal \"Highlander\" type medieval warrior\ncareening around contemporary New York City in a sports car, but also\nthis witchy washy yarn doesn't surpass superior witchcraft fantasies\nsuch as \"Snow White and The Huntsman\" (2012) and \"Hansel & Gretel:\nWitch Hunters\" (2013). The chief problem with this lavishly-produced,\nCGI-laden extravaganza is that it takes itself far too seriously. Apart\nfrom its dire shortage of humor, this dreary potboiler suffers from a\ndearth of quotable dialogue, banal adversaries, and second-rate\nsupporting characters. Gifted thespians like Oscar-winner Michael Caine\nand Elijah Wood shrivel in lackluster roles as our hero's sidekicks who\nare designated as 'Dolans.' \"Sahara\" director Breck Eisner and three\nscenarists, Cory Goodman of \"Priest\" along with Matt Sazama and Burk\nSharpless of \"Dracula Untold,\" have conjured up a synthetic storyline\nthat generates neither charisma nor spectacle. Actually, they appear to\nhave imitated the sensational Wesley Snipes' vampire saga \"Blade\" right\ndown to its rebirth of an ancient blood demon. Similarly, \"The Last\nWitch Hunter\" should have bristled with non-stop momentum, violently\noutlandish combat sequences, and a coherently contrived mythology.\nInstead, it degenerates into a dreary mumbo-jumbo melodrama. The most\nambitious CGI scene pits our hero against a clumsy beast known as 'the\nSentinel,' and he destroys behemoth with a sword as if he were a\nbullfighter straddling it. This unruly creature resembles a huge tiger\nthat appears as it if were assembled from wicker and features a jet\nengine afterburner for its gullet. Our hero's chief adversary is a\nhideous Witch Queen swarming with creepy crawlies who looks like she\nhas spent too many centuries in a mud bath. Moreover, she boasts none\nof the imaginative flamboyance of Charlize Theron's enchantress in\n\"Snow White and the Huntsman.\" "

The main\nproblem is that the authors put some boring CGI in every scene for no\nreason. The second is the cast: it is hard to imagine Vin Diesel in the\nrole of a 800-year old immortal hunter. To be honest: the start is\nhopeful (thanks to the \"13th warrior\"...). In the intense first scene\nhe's wearing some badass hair, beard and costume, but in the rest of\nthe movie he is more looking like some Armani-model from a fashion\nshow. He is talking, walking and acting like Dom Toretto. Which means\nhis suffering is unbelievable too. Despite I think Vin is a likable\nactor and I've really liked him as Riddick.

                "reviews": "\nThe Last Witch Hunter (2015): Dir: Breck Eisner / Cast: Vin Diesel,\nElijah Wood, Rose Leslie, Michael Caine, Julie Engelbrecht: Imbecilic\nscience fiction action film that seems to suggest our defence against\nevil. Vin Diesel plays a cursed witch hunter who is ages in years and\nnow hunts witches in modern day. Elijah Wood plays a young priest who\naids Diesel and comes off as unfortunately laughable because he is\nhardly threatening. His portion of the film is also terribly\npredictable. Rose Leslie looks stunning in her black leather and\nflashing red hair but again, her scenes come off as laughable. She\nworks in a bar, likely to intoxicate herself into figuring out how she\nwent from Game of Thrones to this junk. She is a witch but feels\noutside the box because she is a creature of good yet viewed as a\ncreature of evil because of reputation. Julie Engelbrecht has the good\nfortune of being under heavy makeup so that she can less associate\nherself with this junk. She plays a scary witch whom Diesel stabs a\nhalf dozen times and plays x's and o's with her body while she burns.\nPerhaps the worst aspect is how veteran actor Michael Caine got roped\ninto this. He is friends with Diesel before being cursed into a sleep.\nThat is pretty much his role for the remainder of the film. He might as\nwell be asleep for all the good this tripe will do for his overall\ncareer. The special effects are okay but director Breck Eisner seems to\nlet everything get away on him just like the swarm of insects that\nemerge towards the end. This pointless drivel is so pathetically lame\nthat perhaps jamming a stake through it would do it good. Score: 2 / 10\n"

How the hell can\nanyone see that as a failure is beyond me.

                "reviews": "\nThis was not a bad movie. Why is it thrashed so hard? CGI was good, and\nI liked the overall art style of the movie, color correction and stuff.\nThe plot, however, was messy and the ending was not good at all. It\nalso lacks some interesting dialogue and interactions between the\ncharacters, since there were pretty much nothing like it in the movie.\nVin's character is the only one that goes through some changes, other\ncharacters have no personalities and thus no transformation or any kind\nof change in the end. The idea of immortality can bring in some really\ncreative ideas, which were not present in the movie (check out \"The Man\nfrom Earth\" 2007). As for supporting cast, Rose Leslie was a pleasure\nto look at. Michael Caine had little to no screen time (but some cool\ndialogue with Vin) as well as Wood did. This movie would've been much\nbetter if it was a little longer and had more substance over cool\nvisuals. It was about 106 mins long, not that much by today's\nstandards. Give it 120-130 mins, pack it with character development,\ngive it R rating and I'll give it an 8 or maybe even 9. As of now, it's\na good, but mindless show - 7.\n"

I have read bad reviews about the movie but i think\nthe critics are missing the point, a comedy movie isn't all about\ndepicting a serious story line, but to make you laugh. Kevin Hart stars\nalong side Ice cube in this cop buddy comedy, and just like the first\ninstallment, they embark on a mission to take out the bad guys with the\nusual action and thrill that comes with it. Kevin is 'learning' on the\njob and encounters a lot of hilarious situations. Movie generally has a\nlot of funny moments and i was engaged all through. I would definitely\nrecommend if you are looking to have fun and enjoy a good laugh!\n"

                "reviews": "\nStand-up comic Kevin Hart still cracks me up. The 5-foot. 2-inch,\nbantamweight, motor-mouth, African-American comedian still reminds me\nof Chris Tucker standing in a hole two-feet deep. Hart's hyperactive\nverbosity, enormous impertinence, and infectious vitality make him\nriotous in movies. He could stand around, do nothing, and he would\nstill be hilarious. He stole the show in the first \"Ride Along\" crime\nthriller comedy with Ice Cube, and he is still a scene-stealer in \"Ride\nAlong\" director Tim Story's \"Ride Along 2\" with Ice still staring him\ndown with his glacial glare. Unfortunately, the second \"Ride Along\"\ndoesn't surpass the original. Hart has more than enough minutes to\nclown around in his usual routines, but \"R.I.P.D\" co-scribes Phil Hay\nand Matt Manfredi, who rewrote the original \"Ride Along,\" don't provide\nas many surprises. Remember the two dirty cops that surprised Cube at\nthe end of \"Ride Along?\" Nothing like that happens in this superficial\nsequel. Like the original, \"Ride Along 2\" dutifully recycles every\nclich\u00e9 from those 1980s era police procedurals, but producer Will\nPacker has anted up more Shekels and shifted the predictable,\nfollow-the-dots action to Miami, Florida. If you've seen cop movies\nlike \"Rush Hour,\" \"Fuzz,\" \"48 HRS,\" \"Training Day,\" and \"Paul Blart,\nMall Cop,\" you know what to expect at every turn. \"Ride Along 2\" sticks\nto the formula with slavish zeal, but the camaraderie between Kevin\nHart and Ice Cube as polar opposites overshadows the film's sophomoric\nshenanigans. Indeed, \"Ride Along 2\" resembles one of director Tim\nStory's favorite crime comedies \"Midnight Run\" where a bounty hunter\nsought to shield a mob accountant long enough to get him into witness\nprotection. Story changes the accountant into a computer hacker for\n\"Ride Along 2,\" and zany \"Hangover\" actor Ken Jeong plays the hacker\nwith unusual restraint.\n"

                "reviews": "\nThere's something about Ride Along 2 that makes it a very forgettable\ncomedy movie that I'm probably not going to remember. The story is a\nbuddy cop movie with Kevin Hart as the wild cop who wants to prove\nhimself and Ice Cube as the straight man. There's trouble brewing in\nMiami and it is their time to figure what's going on. I think have\nstart out with the humor, because I feel that there is something\nlacking in that department. It's a real shame because I feel that there\nare some good concepts behind them, but I'm not sure if it's the\nwriting, the directing, or the acting that comes off as unfunny and\nrather boring. I feel that Kevin Hart can be a really funny guy. I know\nthat he's trying but there is something about the movie that's not\nmaking me laugh outside of a few exception. I think the biggest thing\nthat I can think of is that the story just felt so standard and, in a\nweird way, it bleeds itself into the jokes and gags in the movie.\nThere's not anything about it stand itself out from other comedy movies\nthat I've seen in my life. Granted, there are some gags that did work\nbut there just seems more where the gags doesn't hit, and in some\ncases, goes into complete bizarre mode. I will give the movie this,\ncompared to other comedies that I've seen, there's hardly anything\nabout the humor that makes me want to leave the theater (there are some\nweird exceptional gags though), but the fact that it's just so\nforgettable is just sad to me. There's nothing really good about it,\nbut there's not anything really bad about it either. It's just a dull\ncomedy so I would say is that if your one of those people that could\neasily be laughed, then I feel you could get more out of this movie\nthan I can. But for me, this is a movie that I think I'll forget in the\nnear future.\n"

Of course\nbecause this was probably one of the big reasons as to why that movie\ndid well, Universal Studios green lit this sequel. And like other\nsequels that come after their originals, their lack of attention begins\nto show. There's nothing wrong with hiring the majority of the same\ncrew to film a sequel but they have to know how to develop the story\nand not just run on auto-pilot; rehashing everything from the first\nentry.

(I think that is what this is?) I would like to\ngive all the reasons, but the reasons are very simple tbh. I do not\nneed to dissect as to why this is bad. I can however say, that for\nthose looking for reviews and want just a little bit of information. I\nwould be willing to say is that-it's just plain old stupid-bad(annoying\nkind). The 7.5 rating must be from some 11 year old is all I can think.\nAs Gordon Ramsay says \"shut it down!\"\n"

After reading all the positive reviews\nof this 'movie' I'm bound to ask were all those who gave such glowing\nreviews recompensed in some way? I can think of no other reason as to\nwhy or how anyone could possibly say anything positive about this\nincredibly bad movie. It would have been acceptable material for a\nchildren's comic (with the characters words and the ZAP/BANG,WALLOPs\nprominently displayed inside balloons) but as material for a movie? Not\nin a million years. If Lazer Team is in any way representative of the\nway Indie 'humor' movies are heading then I'll have to re-classify the\nmovie Idiocracy into a documentary!!! The acting? More like annoying\nkids having a 'who can act the most stupidly' party. The story(line)?\nDummies save earth from baddie who looked like he (or it?) had borrowed\nit's makeup costume from a whole collection of 1950's B horror movies.\nI could go on about the other components of this piece all of which are\nvery sub-par but see no point in doing so: everything about this movie\nwas simply bad. If you have an IQ greater than that which would be\nrequired for you to decide to step out of the way of a moving train do\nyourself a favor and avoid this movie, or, to paraphrase a Star Trek\nphrase from The Voyage Home ... the movie business is under attack,\navoid this movie at all costs, save yourself!!! Additional summary: an\novertly patronizing insult to your intelligence.\n"

I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth\ncould pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I\nthought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a\nbit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of\nBond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use\nkiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning.\nI've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of\nhumor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but\nit's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't\ndone yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer,\nbut believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before.\nThis is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of\nold-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!\n"

Since James\nBond's debut in 1962, a number of films have attempted to reinvent the\ngenre, with films like 'Johnny English', 'Get Smart', 'This Means War'\nand many more, however, none have come close to displaying the perfect\nblend like 'Kingsman' has. Matthew Vaughn has become renowned for\ntaking on action-comedy projects, for instance 'Kick-Ass' (which is\nstill stronger than this but only just), and along the way has kept\nthat feel-good British aspect to it that makes our greatest secret\nagent (James Bond) such an icon.

It's amusing to\nsee a film be disrespectful about Obama and AGW but the film is morally\nrepulsive and stupid.

The promised chav to gentleman\ntransformation never occurs - apparently being comfortable with who you\nare is what makes a gentleman - with the hero starting as a lout and\nending up as a lout in a bespoke suit. What really sinks the film\nthough is its lack of a moral compass. I could complain about the\ncrudity of having a Swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the\nreal culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with\nhyper-realistic violence. People are tortured and cut in half without a\nqualm. Worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a (hate) church\nfull of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of\nimprovised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as\nif it is entertainment and goes on forever.

They are using young people to tell a story\nthat has no moral and is totally unrealistic. It seems like a\ncelebration of violence, with countless bloody scenes that make you\nsick. They are not offering any interesting points of view but telling\na cheap story through violence, sexism and clich\u00e9s, including a blond\nprincess. I don't see why anyone would want to watch this film and I\ndon't recommend it to anyone. I also feel pretty bad about the cast who\nhave supported such a bad film, even worst on them. They should have\nnever accepted this film.\n"

I was not prepared for this hilarious, crazy action film. It's\nreally, really funny, and it's very violent. I don't know whether many\nwomen are going to like it (I do, but I prefer South Park over Sex and\nthe City and I usually hate chick flicks). It is a comedy but not what\nyou'd expect. And despite this being not at all like X-Men, I\nabsolutely loved the film. And Samuel Jackson is in the film! If you\nlike spy movies and if you're not offended by gory violence and very\ndirty language, go watch this film. The last 30 minutes or so are like\nthe craziest I've ever seen in an action film and I have seen a lot of\naction films, believe me. The storyline is a bit like Men in Black\nwithout aliens, and the young actor who plays the rookie is perfect in\nthis part. The film might not be very realistic, but I thought this was\none of the best action comedies I have seen in a long time.\n"

While it might be the unpopular opinion, I in\nfact enjoyed Guy Ritchie's two Sherlock Holmes films and so decided to\ngive this a chance, knowing nothing about the original TV series this\nmovie was based on and going in with no preconceived notions. One thing\nthat sets it apart from other recent spy thrillers is it staying set in\nthe 60s time period and not being \"modernised\". From the opening \"spy\njazz\" music, it sets the tone for what will be a fun ride. Ritchie's\nunique directing style fits perfectly with this slick/stylish film and\nhe proves once again to have the right touch when it comes to blending\nhumor with serious moments (one example being in the most morbidly\namusing torture sequence I've seen since Bond's in Casino Royale).\nWhilst there are \"talky\" moments and occasions where the camera lingers\non a shot for a solid moment, which those with impatience may grow\nrestless during, there's also action (but not such that it's overkill)\nmixed with humour, some emotional beats and even the odd sexy moment.\nIt all combines extremely well."

So this was a film I \r\nentered with low expectations, and those expectations were pretty well \r\nmet.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the film doesn't have its moments: some amusing \r\nbanter between the two male leads; an atmospheric cold-war Berlin set; \r\nsome high octane scenes that bear stylish comparison to Sergio Leone \r\nWesterns; and the delectable Alicia Vikander (\"Ex Machina\"). \r\n\r\nBut against these plusses it all seemed, at its heart, rather soulless. \r\nFor significant periods of the film I wasn't fully engaged and the film \r\ngrew tiresome, not helped by multiple finales that fizzled out with a \r\ndamp squib intro to the next in the franchise.\r\n\r\nIn terms of feminism, the film doesn't move the ball along very far. \r\nTrue that Vikander's character is an East German car mechanic who knows \r\nhow to wrestle a man to the ground, but once into 'the plot' she is \r\ngiven precious little to do other than dress prettily (something she \r\ndoes, with the help of costume designer Joanna Johnston, very nicely). \r\nOne of the primary villains \u0096 Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki from \"The \r\nGreat Gatsby\") \u0096 is also female, but again the role seems largely \r\ntoothless and revolves around her draped in 60's fashions and pouting a \r\nlot.\r\n\r\nOf the male stars, Cavill and Hammer (which sounds like a make of \r\ntoothpaste) lack any great charisma; Hugh Grant does a good Hugh Grant \r\nimpersonation; with the most fun being had by Sylvester Groth \r\n(\"Inglourious Basterds\") who is creepily entertaining as the ex-Naxi \r\ntorture doctor.\r\n\r\nWhilst eschewing the norm in most reboots of reworking the classic \r\ntheme, Daniel Pemberton's soundtrack is unusual and fits the retro- \r\nnature of the film well, although it can be a little too brash at \r\ntimes. Also retro in nature is the use of 60's style split screens but \r\nthis is much less successful, totally neutering the suspense in some of \r\nthe action sequences. This is most notable in the final Bond-style raid \r\non 'baddie HQ' which, combined with the deafening music track, clearly \r\ncost a lot of budget to stage but is just yawn-worthy dull in its \r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nWith a current 7.6 on IMDb I may be in the minority, but i.m.h.o. it's \r\nworth a Sunday-afternoon watch on DVD but not something to rush to the \r\ncinema to see.\r\n\n"

The end raid is done in\nmultiple split screen shots that remove the viewer from involvement and\n(though not true) feels like stock footage was used and this is a way\nof covering it up. There is very little charisma between Henry Cavill\nand Armie Hammer. I felt Armie Hammer had almost no personality\nwhatsoever.

Alicia Vikander is about as hot\nas you can be right now with the amount of projects she's either\nrumored for or locked in after her Ex Machina success. And Henry Cavill\nis one of the most likable guys in Hollywood. The problem with the film\nisn't the actors at all, in fact, I actually liked Armie Hammer a lot\nhere, which was a big surprise. The problem comes from the stylish\ndirecting and the missed attempt at making an action film with comedy\nin it."

It's a very\ngeneric spy plot which is given lift by being set during the Cold War\nand involving the CIA's best agent (Henry Cavill) and the KGB's best\nagent (Armie Hammer) working together. Overall TMFU is a moderate\nsuccess. Guy Ritchie's direction is visually excellent and unlike the 2\nSherlock Holmes films (Which were good but not exactly Sherlock Holmes)\nhis style fits the movie perfectly. The acting is good all around, with\nArmie Hammer improving on his fairly generic performance in The Lone\nRanger although Henry Cavill occasionally comes across as a bit smug.\nDespite being set in a different time period the film manages not to\nfeel anachronistic and serves up plenty of sleek entertainment.\nUltimately this is basically just lots of style with little substance\nalthough the Cold War setting makes it more interesting."

Portman has to defend him,\nand she rounds up Edgerton, who settled in the area after he found out\nwhat happened to his former fianc\u00e9e, to help her protect them. The\nstory's simple, but Portman and Edgerton carry the film nicely. They\nhave a believable sense of history between them. It's not an\naction-packed film, but it delivers well when it gets to the climax.\nThere are some weaknesses in the details of the film, especially in the\nflashbacks, which often seem skeletal in their scripting (Joel Edgerton\nco-wrote the screenplay with two others). Not great, but good.\n"

True, the musical score of JANE\ncannot touch Ennio Morricone's themes for EIGHT. But, at less than 98\nminutes, JANE is more like an early John Wayne Western (before he got\nbloated), and NOT like a flick whose characters seem suspended between\nday-dreaming and wakefulness, since its director knows that at least\nhalf the audience is asleep. (In other words, you can throw out your\nBurning Yule Log DVD's once THE REVENANT comes out on Blu-Ray, as it\nwill send you to La-La Land much quicker!) The BLACK SWAN herself,\nNatalie Portman, shows as JANE that she'd rather ACT than to attach\nherself to another Billion-Dollar STAR WARS project.

It's sad to see how successful their\nattempts were; I fell for it... for me, it's all due to The Avengers\nbecause that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of\ncommonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this\nextremely disappointing collage. Basically, it's a film made of\ncollages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No\nseriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It's not like the\ngalaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason.\nSo yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in\nouter-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more\nthan this. I'd rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like\nthat says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because\nthe directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes,\npuns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless\nyou are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than\naction-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the\nmoments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was\nliterally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend\nbeside me. Usually I'm not very good at predicting what happens in\nfilms -unless they are seriously full of clich\u00e9s...which this film is-,\nbut I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted.\nAnyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the\nplot of \"saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it\ninvolves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it's not just\nEarth that's being targeted this time so ha we are different\" never got\nTHIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a\nnightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that\nwas intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more\nunique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see\nChris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's pretty butts...but whatever. I had half\nthat mind prepared for a clich\u00e9-turned- awesome movie when I walked in\nthe theater. I came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading\nwith shame and displeasure."

Are the\nfilmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything\nhas to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the\ntedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the\nwriter-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space\nsub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in\na sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first\nhalf hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero\ntakes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to\nthe sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The\ndirector could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were\ntoo tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged\nraaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and\ncynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley\nKubrick.\n"

These marvel films are becoming a\nhuge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to\nconsider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But\nthis?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical\nstereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these\ntheaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly\nsay that it was a \"fantastic\" and \"great\" and \"awesome\" A film that\nwould put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair.\nThe \"Ten out of Ten\" reviews are being given out like candy from these\npeople. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians,\nit's obvious out of the five, there's Groot, the tree humanoid\nincapable of having a conversation, but don't worry it can understand\nwhat you're saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to\nplay and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He's the\ncgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there's a break\nin the scene, here comes Groot and then we say...\"okay Groot, perform\nyour thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?\" Rocket\nRaccoon, what a mess isn't he? Both as a character and the fact that\nmost of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How\nmany scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems\nare towards everyone? What's even worse is the fact everyone is\nlaughing at him in real life, there's no respect for him outside the\nfilm. Oh, and where's his real accent? Though I would have to say he's\nnot the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight\nof Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it's\nhumanoid actors. And what of Quill, Gamora, and Draxx? David Bautista\nas Draxx was actually the better of the three, in the overall\nperformance (if any) Why? Well, you'll be sharing this characters\nmaniacal laughter once you've realized you wasted valuable devotion for\na franchise whose focus is better spent on a festival of explosions\nrather than a film focusing on Quality. Oh, but wait! Quill and his\nquirks and Gamora as the feminism object! Dun, Dun, Dun! The perfect\ntrio nowadays are the idiots and the friendly brutes and the\nthreatening but soft spot woman! Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana... WHAT\nCOULD GO WRONG...oh I don't know... Let's start predicting before we\nstart watching the film... Is there a sex scene? It's PG-13, so no, but\nis there a RomCom kiss scene? You BETCHA! Ah, what a romanticism of a\nfilm! Please let me just change my rating from 6 to ZERO"

For example, not a single human dies\nduring the movie, Starlord just uses his electric shock thing when he\nfires at humans. And the movie was to \"un-serious\", there were jokes\nevery minute which made it impossible to watch the movie at the cinema\nbecause everyone just laughed like hell when there was a small joke\nthat actually wasn't funny at all, well some jokes were a little funny\nbut none of them made me laugh. I may sound like a horrible person for\ndoing this but the only time i laughed was at the beginning of the\nmovie when (SPOILER ALERT) starlord's mom was lying sick in the\nhospital, me and my friend started laughing uncontrollably and i don't\neven know why. I guess that we started laughing because we knew that\nyou aren't supposed to laugh to those things. Everyone stared at us...\nAnyways the movie also had lots of predictibale moments and some parts\nof it was a little clich\u00e8, (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) and the end battle\nthat they made you look forward to was the most anti climax end to a\nmovie i have ever seen, they killed the main villain so quick. Overall\nthe effects and animated things in the movie were extremely good, the\nsetting was good, the jokes were al little entertaining but there were\nway too many jokes in the movie and there was a lack of death and gore,\nthe the movie was way too short and the characters didn't have time to\ndevelop, and the plot was way to predictable and clich\u00e9. You didn't see\nany blood or gore during the movie at all which made the movie way to\ncomedic. I would prefer the movie to be more serious and \"grown up\". I\nwould give it 6/10 but that is for people over 11 y.o, for a child this\nmovie would be perfect, from the perspective of a child i would have\ngiven it 9.5/10. And if they had made it less childish i would switch\nthe scores so that it was 9.5/10 for people over 11 and 6/10 for\nchildren. I hope that the sequel will be more grown up. (The sequel's\nplot is also very predictable, if you have seen the first one you will\nknow exactly what will happen in the second one.)\n"

And watching Pratt as Starlord is exactly\nlike watching Ryan Reynolds as..well Ryand Reynolds. Plus there were a\nton of plot holes that took me out of the film. Ronan was known to be\nworking for Thanos; it was no secret? So if Thanos was more powerful\nthan Ronan, why didn't he just go get the damn orb himself?

I love\nspecial effects, but it did sound like this movie was made \"only\" to\nshowcase special effects such as explosions, explosions, explosions and\ndid I forget to say explosions? The special effects were indeed\nmagnificent, but it doesn't take long for you to realize it is all eye\ncandy. It is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made\nfor ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow. For everyone else, and by\neveryone else I mean adults with thinking brains, this extremely\nshallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a\nshowcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques. Surprise,\nsurprise, special effects do not make up for a shallow, childish, and\nextremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to\ndownright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature person's\ntime.

Instead of taking the good and improving on the first one, this\nmovies is basically just hunger games, trying to get away from the bad\nguys just to get caught type of stuff, and hunger games, these infected\nhuman/zombie like creatures chasing people around. Normally I'd still\ngive a movie a chance but I just couldn't. One main reason is the CGI\nfor this movie, it was just laughable. CGI was used for all of the\ninfected characters chasing the main group around and it just looked\nlike CG from movies and video games from 5 years ago, just terrible.\nThey go so far from the book plot line it's ridiculous too. If you want\nto see it wait until it comes out to online rental or redbox or video\nstore. It's not worth paying to see in theaters. Also warning to adults\ntaking kids, this movie is closer to an R rating than a PG-13, it's a\nreally far stretch that they made it only PG-13.\n"

Originally when the first one released, I\ndidn't really care to see it but when I finally watched the first one I\nwas very pleased. It was actually a lot of fun. It's simple and has a\nslight moral message but the action and intrigue and characters were\nall very good. So now I was a fan enough to look forward to the second\none. I will say that I think they definitely rushed Maze Runner: The\nScorch Trials. They were too caught up in the release one instalment\nevery year idea. The Scorch Trials feels completely different in a lot\nof ways from the first film. I have not read the books so I can't speak\nto the similarities but it sounds like readers hate the movie. From an\nentertainment standpoint, The Scorch Trials is decent. Its still well\nacted though I think they could have developed the characters a little\nmore because now it feels like this is all about special effects and\nmonsters and the extended post-apocalyptic world. There are some great\ntwists and turns and some interesting plot points so it is far from a\ntotal loss."

But I did watch the first part, which\nwas pretty good and like all good films, left loads of questions open.\nIn this part the most basic questions are still not answered properly,\nThomas' and Theresa's past at WCKED is mention occasionally but I still\nhave no idea why they made a maze, why the virus even broke out, who\nexactly WCKED plans to save (?) by killing teens? And why do they work\nwith teens when children have most fluid? This film is completely\nillogical, for example, it is explained that children's brains produce\nan enzyme that is immune, which cannot be manufactured, which is why\nWCKED kinda collects teens (but why the maze? To test their IQ?): to\ndrain the fluid. But I mean there has to be a more effective way right?\nFor example, they could pair the immune teens up and make them make\nimmune babies or sthm. And what is the point in killing bunches of\npeople so other people get to live a few months longer? I wouldn't call\nthat saving the human race. Whats worse though, is the characters. It's\nlike when one shines light on zombie humans for the 3rd time, making\nthem awaken and aggressive, one would start running instead of standing\nthere, still illuminating them, waiting for the zombies to untangle\nthemselves and chase after you. Also, seeing its the 3rd time you\nswitch the light on and zombies awaken, you should have grasped that\nthey are attracted to light. And why zombies anyway? They turned this\nmovie into a zombie apocalypse with shitty characters. The characters\nare so annoying dumb and have no logic at all!!! For example, at the\nend when one friend is taken, Thomas decides to get him and destroy\nwcked in the process... How reasonable is that?! Additionally, Theresa,\nthe girl, tells Thomas on several occasions that she wants to go back\ncos she believes wcked is good, but he just doesn't get that Theresa's\non wcked's side and will sell them out. Take a hint will ya? Or another\nexample: one guy gets bitten and is really weak the next day. Everyboby\nis concerned, but nobody thinks of checking the actual wound till he\ncollapses. I honestly have no idea how I finished this movie, in some\nways I do wanna know how it ends because I like the characters from the\n1. Part (this one ruined them though), but I certainly nearly stopped\nnumerous times. Please take my advice and don't ruin the trilogy by\nwatching this piece of 61 million dollar rubbish!\n"

But the\nextensive use of shaky cam rendered what would have been enjoyable\naction scenes almost unwatchable. I don't know why film makers these\ndays have latched on to this fad. I don't get motion sick. Mostly I\nfind the constant shaking just down right annoying. You get shots of\nground or wall or the back of someone's head, instead of an action\nscene that is comprehensible where the audience can see what is taking\nplace. I realize the intent is to give a sense of realism, but let's\nface it; we don't see the world shake and move like this when we\nourselves run around. I would say somewhere around 75% of the action\nwas done in shaky cam. On top of that, some of the scenes where the\ncharacters are just sitting around chatting is also done in shaky cam.\nNext time, advertise the movie as a found footage movie, so I at least\nknow to avoid it. Wes Bell is going on my list with Paul Greenglass as\ndirectors whose movies to avoid.\n"

The first movie was a\nsci-fi/mystery/thriller combination, while this second one focuses\nmainly on action. I like good action films and this one had a lot of\nthat but like in most cases the original first film and idea are\nbetter. Nevertheless this second entry combines the element of urgency\nwith constant running action scenes and is a nice choice to accompany\nyour pop corn with. Direction and sound are nicely executed and the\nyoung actors' performances are solid. Dylan O' Brien will some day\nbecome a star (of course not as big as Jennifer Lawrence).

It is nowhere near as big as\nThe Avengers, or The Avengers: Age of Ultron, or Captain America: The\nWinter Soldier, or Iron Man, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or any of the\nother Marvel films. It it small, funny, and emotional. The effects are\njust as good as the other films in the MCU, but the script, characters,\nand story make this unique. The characters are funny, but deep. The\nscript is witty yet emotional. The story is on such a small scale:\nSure, he saves the world. But what if Scott Lang (the Ant-Man) failed?\nThen Hope Van Dyne would take over. And if she failed? Hank Pym could\nnot do it. He is too old now. In his prime, sure, but not now. If none\nof those three, the three main characters in the movie, could do it,\nthen the Avengers would do it. End of story. This is not a scenario\nnearly as big as the fate of Earth or the entire galaxy. It is a story\nof a man and his daughter. Hank and Hope, and Scott and Cassie. Men and\ntheir daughters. Sure, there is a villain, some hilarious side\ncharacters, laugh-out-loud moments and witty dialogue, but it is about\nfamily more than anything. That is what makes Ant-Man so great. It is\nnot just about a superhero, or a team of superheroes, but about the\nrelationship between a parent and their child. That alone makes the\nmovie worth seeing, not including the epic action scenes, hilarious\nmoments, great writing, fantastic acting, and more. If you miss\nAnt-Man, you are missing one of the best films in the MCU, and one of\nthe best films of the year.\n"

A lot of\npeople were skeptical about this film, but I wasn't one of them, I'm a\nhuge Marvel fan and I own all their movies and watch all their shows ,\nand they haven't let me down once, so why would I have reason to\nbelieve they would make a bad film? That's right I didn't. This movie\nwas filled with the most original action scenes, and the humor was\nhilarious throughout. The script was well written, and that lead to\npretty good pacing. The performances from Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas,\nEvangeline Lilly, Michael Pena, and of course Corey Stoll were\nexcellent, and the rest of the actors did great. The story was good,\nthe direction was good, the costume designs are great as well. The\nvillain is one of the best Marvel has done, even though Ultron was top\nnotch as a villain. Corey Stoll was intimidating and downright psycho,\nhe even was horrible enough to kill a sheep and hold a little girl\nhostage. I hope we get a sequel real fast, and I think we will, Marvel\nwill be stupid not too. I think Civil War will generate enough buzz for\na Ant-man sequel to make money. I'm really looking forward to Marvels\nnext installments, because I love Marvel. I highly recommend this\nfunny, Heist movie, with great original action scenes, and great\nperformances. Please go see this movie.\n"

The movie had a fluent, funny way to\ntell a straight up heist story with a twist. It made me laugh, cry and\nsometimes left me in awe. The shrunk scenes had epic cinematography.\nThe action felt fluent as it was kinda tense and had no shaky cam\nmadness. I never felt lost at the fight and chase scenes. The plot had\ntouchy moments that didn't feel out of place. Performances were amazing\nespecially by Paul Rudd and Micheal Douglas. Scott is a sloppy, less\nrich, more caring Iron-Man. Paul Rudd did a great job of delivering the\nsometimes lost but still sassy Ant-Man. Villain was kinda weak but\nbelievable and enough to fill the part. In the end this is one of the\nbest MCU movies also one of the best of its kind in its year.\n"

In between I remember\nwatching horribly awkward dialouge and a totally messed up story. For\nexample how come a world famous physician is on the same time a\nbiologist with the ability to communicate with ants. Wouldn't it be\nmore logical that Ant-Man himself starts to bond with ants, because his\nnew size offered him a new perspective to the world. About this\nsuperficial family conflict, which reminded me of a lot of others in\nmovies I already have seen before, I don't want start writing about.\nDue to the script the acting was awkward too, only Michael Douglas,\nT.I. and Michael Pena now and then seemed to breath some authenticity\nand life into their characters.

Little kids will\ndefinitely love this because of the rude humor and all of the very\nfunny but yet cheesy jokes because my Brother could not stop laughing\nwhen the movie got even farther and farther the more funny and cheesy\nit became after all it is called Ant-Man. The cool thing about this\nmovie is that it was like Spider-Man & Mega Mind because Scott is not\nused to the Ant-Man Suit and messes everything up exactly like\nSpider-Man and the thing with Mega Mind is that he is bad at first but\nthen he becomes good. Another fun fact about this is that it is about a\nman who can shrink down to the size of an insect and Walt Disney\nPictures merged with Marvel on a shrinking movie and Walt Disney\nPictures is know for the Honey Shrunk franchise which is really funny\nand cool except they have a Shrink Gun and Scott has a Suit.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI sincerely hope the original Point Break is much different than this\nlifeless, hippy-dippy, overblown Mountain Dew commercial. I've never\nseen the original movie, so I have no bias towards it. Based on the\nmovie's own merit's, the Point Break remake is laughably awful. In\nPoint Break, a rookie FBI agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes\nwho go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and\nlife-threatening ways; they plan to do a series of near- impossible\nstunts called the Ozaki 8 in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment.\nAt least, that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie\ndevolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme\nsports clips that could have been easily viewed on YouTube, all set to\nirritating club music. It takes a special director to make BASE jumping\nand cliff diving this boring. Ericson Core builds as little suspense as\npossible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly\nwell-shot highlights reels for the action scenes. Any sort of suspense\nconjured up is because of the great cinematography because the\ncharacters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get\nkilled off. Everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind. All\nthey do is spit faux- philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after\nthe first twenty minutes. It gets laughable towards the end of the\nmovie with lines like \"Ideas are strong. But not as strong as a whaling\nship,\" and no amount of context will make that line any less\nridiculous. The unbearable dialog, muddled plot and dull characters\nmakes this Point Break remake utterly pointless. If you're not a fan of\nremakes, this will make you reach your breaking point.\n"

The second mistake is the absurd\namount of money committed to the production of this bland,\neco-environmental crime thriller, if in fact that is what it can\nactually be called. In saying this though, the cinema was at capacity\nfor the reinvention of Kathryn Bigelow's original edgy crime thriller\nthat quickly became a cult classic upon its release back in 1991. Most\nof the audience were there on the pretense that they were about to\nwitness a crafty update packed with plenty of glorious thrilling\naction. What you actually get is a misguided film that preaches its\nobvious left wing message and forgets to develop any bona fide\nrelationships between the cast.

I\nthink the director carefully kept the original themes which weave the\nvarious characters and actions together. These are the sacred nature of\nour planet, the need to follow your destiny and the incredible power of\nthe moment. Flash forward to 2015, our planet is in even more serious\ntrouble. Life is tough, people are tougher. Bodhi is now more of a man\nof action than previously. He still has a devoted team around him that\nbelieve in what they are doing. Almost like a crew of Vikings about to\nsail off the known edge of the planet. The actions scenes are out of\nthis world, no doubt about it. I was reminded of \"Riding Giants\",\n\"Storm Surfers\" and \"Sunshine Superman\". These scenes make the movie\nand you wish you could join the athletes. Samsara is the more mystical\nof the crew and offsets the hard edges of the film.\n"

Yet the impact\nof these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost\nevery other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay,\nevery second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the\nair or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing.\nWimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with\nclich\u00e9d stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies,\nit's just a matter of how\", it's nothing short of unintentionally\nhilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going\nto be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic\neco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for\nlow-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as\nJohnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis.

Performance from the casts are overall\nfine but the decision to focus on the extreme adventures have totally\nneglected the potential of some supporting characters and the emotional\ndevelopment that cause the romance and friendship seems to be\nsuperficial. Visual effects are environmental breathtaking and\nstunning, the scores by Junkie XL are strong and inspiring yet all of\nthese are insufficient to provide additional thrills to make the film\nsuperior than the original cult in 1991.\n"

But the basis\nis only that the characters have the same names. Point Break is an\naction film best suited for testosterone-charged teen boys. The plot\ngoes nowhere. The acting is weak (at best). The film's attempt to\nattach a philosophy to the extreme sports is juvenile at best. Point\nBreak is too loud. There were too many tattoos. The FBI does not really\nrun independent international operations. On the positive side (yes\nthere is one--barely), the 3D photography is spectacular. The extreme\nsports scenes are impressive. If it weren't for the photography, I'd\nrate this film 0. The last 3D film I saw was Friday the 13th, Part 3.\nIt's plot was no worse than that of Point Break. The real star of the\nfilm is the 3D photography. It is a shame that a better plot could not\nhave been found. Lacking that, making an extreme sports documentary of\nthe sports scenes would have resulted in a much more enjoyable film.\n"

If you are a fan of\nthe original Point Break by Kathryn Bigelow, the film where Patrick\nSwayze played a bank robbing surfer who took Keanu 'I am an FBI agent'\nReeves under his wing, watch that film again. If you are in the mood\nfor crazy stunts and set pieces, open YouTube and watch some extreme\nsports videos on there. These are comparatively sound alternatives to\nthis dreck, courtesy of director Ericson Core who has made his first\nfilm since 2006. It might take another nine years and extensive therapy\nto overcome this stain. The film is so bad and amateurishly composed\nthat it appears someone first listed off a series of extreme stunts and\ntold Core and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Salt) to write the movie around\nthem no matter how jarring or ill-fitting they may seem. If you're\nstill wondering, the stunts don't work on their own because the\nscript's lousiness makes them boring since there's no investment in the\none- dimensional characters and the weak performances of the actors."

To start with, I\ncouldn't swallow the hollow \"new age\" philosophy of the villains (it\nmight be more appropriate to call them \"anti-heroes\"), full of vague\nwordiness which sounds deep despite not meaning anything (\"You only see\nthe limits... I only see the truth\"). And their actions don't make much\nsense. Sometimes, they want to \"return something to Earth\"\n(translation: stealing the rich and giving the poor), while in other\noccasions, they seem simple eco-terrorists or simple thieves seeking a\nbooty to finance their adventures. Example: the only bank robbery in\nthe film occurs at a bank on the top of a mountain. Why? Because they\ncan escape on motorbikes and funiculars, with the snowy tops as a\nsetting of the action. It's easy to notice that Point Break (2015)\nisn't interested in telling a congruent and interesting story, unlike\nthe 1991 film (useless information: the original Point Break was the\nfirst movie I bought on LaserDisc). This remake only wanted to include\nas many samples of extreme sports as possible, without caring about the\nsacrifice of logic in the story. Having said that... the mentioned\nsports exhibitions are visually attractive (director Ericson Core\ndefinitely took advantage of his long experience as a cinematographer)\nand very well done. Needless to say, there's abundant digital\nmanipulation, but the feats feel \"real\" and extremely dangerous. The\nspecial effects work is perfect, allowing the creation of good action\nsequences. Useless information number two: Point Break (2015) has the\nlongest end credits I have seen in a long time. It's almost 15 minutes\nof \"sports consultants\", local services in the numerous countries where\nthe film was shot and at least a dozen of special effects studios,\nincluding lola VFX, Image Engine and VPP; but the effort was worthy. I\nwish I could flatter the screenplay as much; and the least I say about\nthe forced romantic sub-plot, the better. Meanwhile, the accomplices of\nthe band are so poorly defined that, when one of them dies, we don't\neven know which one it was. Was it the one with beard and tattoos, or\nthe one with beard and tattoos, or the one with beard, tattoos and\nlenses? And that narrative sterility is what marks Point Break (2015)\nfrom the beginning to the end. As I said before, the \"extreme\" scenes\nare well done, but everything else is as interesting as the previously\nmentioned end credits. If we only take the action scenes, Point Break\n(2015) might work as a long extreme sports commercial; pity that, in\nits whole shape, we also have an uninteresting screenplay and bad\nperformances.\n"

Unfortunately, the master-student relationships didn't\nmake the story wider enough. But it is still entertaining, beautiful\nand dramatically as well. One of the interesting thing is \"Donnie Yen\nVS Mike Tyson\". The fighting sequence was extremely phenomenon. But the\nbattle only lasts for 3 minutes and it's too short for me to watch this\nintensive battle. Finally the ending, It's sad when i heard in one of\nthe scene the doctor said that she only has 6 months to live. I watch\nit and i couldn't speak. it was like OMG I'm so sorry to hear that. But\nwhat can i say, This is what life is all about..."

The\nproblem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or a\ndream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they're\ndreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooner\nor later you stop caring about the actual action because it's a dream.\nSo the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the\npouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up a\nski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what's-his-name float\naround a hotel just didn't do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd\ngreatest movie ever? You must be dreaming.\n"

Just when you thought Christopher Nolan\ncouldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering\nanother masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has\nbeen lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions\nvs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention\nlike an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what\nwill happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No\nwonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a\ndirector, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the\nfilm is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate\nlike MANY films before."

The\naudience were like; \"OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A\nMasterpiece!!\" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the\nwhole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most\nof the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended\nso they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;\"I don't\nreally think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am\na genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the\nmind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!\" The intention of\nthe film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain\naudience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the\ndirector/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie\ngenius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was\ngreat and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off.\nLook at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were\ncomplete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected\nin the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that's what we\ngot. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really\npoint the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I\nwould rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They\nsaid the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping\nonions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a\nchicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb's wife\nliving with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you\nserious!! How come you haven't seen that one coming!! It was so\nobvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it\nseem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you\nkidding me!!\n"

Though the\nrealm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight\nattempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's\nBox, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet\nof reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but\nnot to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the\nconcept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements\nof Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created\na niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie\ncalled Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies\nlike Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His\nunremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the\nunexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag,\nwhich gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan\ndesperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible\nadvantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not\nonly dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other\nthing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the\nmovie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes\nmultiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well\non both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the\nbalance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is\nso adequate that it's impossible to separate them. "

The special\neffects are very fantastic especially when the movie was made before I\nwas even born, even Return of the Jedi was made 7 years before I was\nborn, or should I say it was completed 7 years before I was born. It's\nlike George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies\nincluding Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in\ntime a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must\nsay George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a\nlong time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I\nmean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George\nLucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie\nabout what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace\nand he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars\nEpisode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan\nof Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I\ndidn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was\njust amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time,\n1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy\nSpecial Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital\nTechnology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And\nwhen I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much\nbetter with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But\nthe Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi\nat the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda\nand Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced\nAnakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and\nEpisode III. You shouldn't have done that George. It's great you\nre-modified the Trilogy and all with new technology but don't destroy\nthe plot, because not even Luke Skywalker is going to have no idea who\nthat person is, and you didn't make Obi-Wan Kenobi look like Ewan\nMcGregor so I don't see why you did that. George try to re-modify\nReturn of the Jedi that way it was before, the face that Luke Skywalker\nsaw him as when he took off that black mask and helmet that Anakin\nSkywalker needs to live. Alright. That's all I have to say.\n"

                "reviews": "\nTruly a landmark film. When it came out, there had never been anything\nlike it before, and it truly caused quite a stir. I would contend that\nit is not as good as its sequel, Empire Strikes Back; but it is still a\ngreat movie. There is humor, action, and some heartfelt moments. It is\nalso our introduction to some great characters that people will never\nforget - Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan\nKenobi...and of course everyone's favorite villain, Darth Vader. Alec\nGuinness really is outstanding in this movie. His role as Luke's first\nmentor is understated and believable...his somewhat tired attitude in\nretrospect seems very understandable after watching the prequels -\nafter all he's been through, it is very believable when he tells Luke,\n\"I'm getting to old for this sort of thing.\" The visual effects are not\nonly groundbreaking, but they still hold up very well even in this\nCGI-effects laden era. I would contend that ILM's use of modeling and\nlighting in the old films actually lends a more believable look to the\naction scenes than the prequels' use of video-game style battles and\nsensory overload. There is great chemistry between the actor's - and\nwhile Luke is a bit annoying, the back and forth of Han and Chewbacca,\nand C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as Leia's chemistry with Han and Luke,\nmake this movie extremely entertaining on an emotional level - it also\nmakes you care about the characters. Let us compare the lightsaber duel\nof this movie with that from Phantom Menace. Although the acrobatics\nand sheer fury of the duel just are not there in A New Hope, we\nactually feel something when Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down.\nConversely, when Qui-Gon Jinn is slain, there is not the same (if any)\nfeeling after it is done. Well, I'm rambling now. But this movie has it\nall. Space battles, lightsaber duels (a la Samurai flicks), chase\nsequences, thinly veiled references to the Western genre in the Canteen\non Tatooine. A Truly great adventure that, as it ended, was really just\nbeginning.\n"

                "reviews": "\nThe very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's\ntitle in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very\nmoment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget,\ngrand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple\nstories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas\ndecided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby\nCobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he\nhimself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa,\nthe Western-themed \"Hidden Fortress,\" with one scene (the fight in the\nbar) lifted from \"Yojimbo.\" As a result, \"Star Wars\" has a bit of the\njittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't\nquite made for them, like people with past life experiences that\nintrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but\nTHREE heroes in \"Star Wars\" (four if you include the princess, who has\na more prominent role in \"Star Wars\"). Hamill's Luke is often\novershadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any\nfine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a\nstar), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined\nfarmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, \"Star Wars\" sets the\nstandard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry\nwas bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest,\ntoylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in \"Space: 1999\"\nin favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping\nmovement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No\nwonder there's never any sex. \"Star Wars\" is science fiction only\nbecause it's set in outer space, by which standard \"Dirty Harry\" is a\ndetective story & \"Last Tango in Paris\" a romance. Little attempt is\nmade to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out\nwhy light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory\nexplanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be\ncounted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the\nMillennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed\ntime. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a\nsmuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or\nengineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded\nexcess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap &\neasy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, \"Star Wars\" creates an array\nof badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema,\nheaded by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in \"Star\nWars\" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin\n(Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded\nphrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (\"This station\nis now the ultimate power in the universe!\" \"This bickering is\npointless!\" \"I find your lack of faith disturbing\"). Perhaps, with the\nspace program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy\ncoming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was\nwearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of \"Star Trek\" to bring\nthe writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil.\nNever again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be\nto \"Star Wars\" than that the \"Star Trek\" movies of the 1980s followed\nthe simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of \"Star Wars,\"\nturning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps\nthat first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic\nDefense Initiative nicknamed it \"Star Wars\" so convincingly that the\noriginal name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with\nits holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!)\nwhich likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which\nbecame more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the\nsequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the\nCode of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke &\nKenobi. \"Star Wars\" can't really be judged by the standards of other\nfilms, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it\nbecame, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no\ndoubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the\nviewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over\nagain, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard.\nIf you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all\nskepticism, lower your shields & prepare to make the jump to\nhyperspace.\n"

                "reviews": "\nGeorge Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic\nfantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian\nscience-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American\nGraffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon\nstrip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known\nAmericans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story\nis a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns\nand every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on\na close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate\nsuccess. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It\nspawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a\ndemand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial\nLight and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became\na multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has\nremained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly\nstruck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the\nVietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star\nWars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave\nhis proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original\nStar Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing\nhabit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that\ndepend on special effects rather than on character and subtle\nnarrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be\ncalled 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.\n"

While, George Lucas did give his\nJedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and\ncertainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original\nStar Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching\nthe film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of\nthe movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release,\nit gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry,\nMichael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain."

It was a recording from a\ntelevision broadcast and was missing the first few minutes, so the\nopening shots were of C-3PO and R2-D2 walking over the dunes of\nTatooine. That planet is not, of course, named in the movie; strange as\nit is to think, there must have been a brief span of time when I knew\nthe movie pretty well but didn't know the colossal amount of trivial\ninformation that I permanently internalized during my teen years. For a\nwhile I had no idea there were sequels. But the details and backstories\nthat books and games and movies and TV shows have filled in over the\ndecades were in a way already present, at least implicitly, at the\noutset. It is well-known that George Lucas was inspired by old sci-\nfi/adventure serials, and that he tried to give this \"episode\" of Star\nWars the feel of belonging to a far grander saga whose beginning and\nend were far off. It was an audacious, brilliant move, and it worked on\nmy younger self exactly as intended. I was able to conjure images of\nLuke's heroic father, supposedly killed in the off-handedly mentioned\nClone Wars, and I was able to get a sense of what those conflicts were\nlike from the way that Alec Guinness looked and sounded when he talked\nabout the past. I could feel the long history of Obi-Wan and Vader's\nrelationship in the way they appraised each other during their\nshowdown. I could imagine, vaguely, the previous ups and downs of the\nrebel alliance and the off-screen machinations of Imperial Senate. That\nthese things were planted in my imagination made the movie feel big and\nepic, though it is probably the \"smallest\" installment in the Star Wars\nfranchise in terms of the size and number of sets, the number of\ncharacters with speaking roles, and other metrics. The series has not\nalways benefited from trying to depict on-screen the people and events\nthat were at first only evocative allusions. I sometimes wish I could\nforget everything I've learned from the ever-expanding Star Wars\nuniverse (and that, believe me, is a lot) in order to feel again the\nway I felt when all I had to go on was \"A New Hope,\" and it was more\nthan enough.\n"

The film is rapturously beautiful, it was filmed\nwith 4K cameras which is definitely the way in which to see it as it\nwas stunning. The film stars Tom Cruise who can make anything watchable\n(as he did with Knight and Day, barely) and he brings a familiar face\nfor somewhere completely foreign territory, as the world has been\ndevastated by a war for earth. He is joined by Morgan Freeman who does\nnot feature as much as the poster would have you believe, also Andrea\nRiseborough and Olga Kurylenko. The best thing about the film is the\naction which works very well and we have a Texan Melissa Leo at mission\ncontrol who is a figure of mystery and plays to some of the more\ninteresting parts of the film such as who creation and the feeling of\nhome, which Cruise does. The film has the tag-line \"Earth is a memory\nworth fighting for\" and this film is definitely worth seeing on the\nbiggest screen with the best projector possible.\n"

                "reviews": "\nGranted Oblivion takes inspiration from countless sci-fi classics, \r\ngranted that it lets a larger than life star consume it, granted it \r\nlets visual flair and elegance triumph mind bending probabilities, but \r\nthere is no denying the fact that it is one hell of an entertainer, and \r\nprobably THE sci-fi vehicle that Tom Cruise wanted all his life, \r\nSpielberg aside.\r\n\r\nA long preamble sets the dystopian background- it is the year 2077, and \r\nthe earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the \r\nmoon, thus destabilizing the earth, causing earthquakes and tsunamis. \r\nNuclear annihilation followed, and as the earth became inhabitable, the \r\nsurviving humans moved to Titan, a moon of Saturn, while alien \r\nscavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the \r\nearth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by \r\ndrones, which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a \r\nstylish, minimalistic floating facility in the clouds, with wiped out \r\nmemories- Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea \r\nRiseborough), who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is \r\nthis the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have \r\nhaunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won \r\nthe war?\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you \r\nnever lived?\"\r\n\r\nOblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I am \r\nlegend, Independence Day, @Moon, Star Wars, Total Recall, The Matrix \r\nand of course, WALL\u0095E to create a striking, visually resplendent \r\nfeature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi (film), Claudio Miranda \r\ncreates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and \r\nvisual effects- an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked \r\nwith craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it, and lush, \r\nunspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective, not \r\noverpowering, and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt \r\nwith. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters, a \r\ndreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence, taking direct \r\ninspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As \r\nrevelations unravel, he gets into superstar mode with minimal \r\nfussiness- cool vehicles, check. Weapons, check. Beautiful babes, \r\ncheck. Mission to save the world, check. Risenborough is superb as the \r\nicy cool, rule following partner, Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an \r\nessentially damsel in distress role, while Morgan Freeman is his usual \r\nsolid self in a cameo. \r\n\r\nDirector Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the \r\nproceedings, and like his previous effort Tron Legacy, gives a solid \r\nbonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum \r\nup, Oblivion may not be terribly original, but it is stylish, well \r\nwritten and got performances to boot- especially Cruise who is in red \r\nhot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve, but in the immortal words of \r\nRoxette- it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and \r\nenjoy a summer spectacle.\n"

STOP RECYCLING THE SAME IDIOTIC GARBAGE! MOST OF THE\nMOVIE VIEWERS ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU ARE! Do not get confused by all\nthose 10-star reviews. Most of them are done by paid \"reviewers\". This\nmovie is wrong tactically. Every tactical aspect is wrong and stupid.\nSTUPID. Should I even attempt to mention the tactical flaws? a) No\ncamouflage is used by the main character. He can be seen from miles\naway. b) Why the concept of helmets is lost so completely? The main\ncharacter does not wear a helmet even when he rides a dirt bike (a\nwhite dirt bike). c) A huge, long WHITE-colored rifle will get in one's\nway most of the time. Did anyone notice any spare mags? d) What is the\nstory with the rifle-mounted flash light? Don't they have any NVGs or\nlight-amplifying sights? No camouflage + bright flashlights? Do they\nwant to be detected by anyone from miles away? e) The main character is\nconstantly exposed, because he ridiculously works alone. There is no\none to spot for the guy who does repairs and therefore cannot watch his\n6 o'clock. He acts as though he is alone on the entire planet, although\nhe is so obviously not alone. f) No body armor?! Why? The main\ncharacter is evidently challenged by various opposing forces, but he\nhas no ballistic protection (see the part b about the absence of\nhelmets). g) If, or rather, when that flimsy flying machine brakes, the\nmain character will be stuck in the middle of radioactive no where. I\nwould not take this job. e) Since the flying machine is not a\nhelicopter, then why does it have a large tail with a fan? A tail rotor\nis only used on single-rotor helicopters. The flyer in the movie is a\nheavily thrust-vectoring machine with two engines. So, the tail with a\nfan becomes utterly useless, obviously. Also, whatever kind of concepts\nthey employ are WAY OVERUSED! Crushed Moon, crumbling Earth, robots\ngetting out of control, clones, Earth invasion, ruined Manhattan, etc.\nWhiskey, Tango, Fox is wrong with you, Hollywood? You people keep\nreleasing piles of the same nonsense again and again and again! Also,\nall this sentimental BS is tiring. Just to make the movie appeal to\nlove-starved house-wives, the producers had to add tons of boring\n\"feely\" sentimentality and unappealing \"romance\". I do not even feel\nlike reviewing such pile of garbage. No, I did not finish watching this\nmovie. I got sick of all the silly nonsense. Thank you, Hollywood.\nPlease, keep making the 100% recycled post-consumer sort of movies, so\nthat more people can learn to appreciate and to watch the old classics\nmore often! At least I know for sure that the old \"dream factory\" is\ntotally ruined now.\n"

First lets go through the cast. Tom Cruise did an\nexcellent job as Jack and Olga Kurylenko also delivered as Julia. Their\nchemistry worked in the movie and I believed in their part of the\nstory. But other actors chiefly Morgan freeman and Nikolaj\nCoaster-Waldau (Kingslayer in Game Of thrones) were criminally\nunderused and had just a few bits of dialogue. It would have been\nbetter to cast lesser known actors to fill their role. The story itself\nis very interesting yet as most people will notice, highly predictable.\nStill there is enjoyment in this film since it is very beautiful to\nlook at. The cinematography is excellent and the special effects are\ntop notch. I was never bored during the movie and there are some plot\ntwists that surprised by the time I was done watching. It might not be\nthe summer blockbuster you were waiting for but you will not go out of\nthe movie theatre disappointed!"

Jack 49\nsomehow knows the outcome of the 2017 Superbowl, when in the flashback,\nthe original Jack says he doesn't want Sally to ruin the outcome for\nhim. 2.) When Jack and Julia meet, Julia wants to get the flight\nrecording back from the remains of the ship. We later find out that the\nremains of the ship are from the \"escape pod\" part of the ship, while\nJack and Victoria were flying in the cockpit. Why would the flight\nrecording be in the pod and not the cockpit? 3.) Julia describes her\nmission. The thing is, how could Julia know the mission was reassigned,\nif she was in Delta sleep so she could get to Titan? 4.) At the end of\nthe movie, Jack 52 finds Julia at the cabin after 3 years. With some of\nthe memories the original Jack had and memories of Jack 49. Does this\nmean thousands of the Jacks will show up at the cabin? 5.) How in the\nheck did Julia give birth alone? Surely she didn't have to rip the\numbilical cord with her bare hands. 6.) What happened to all the other\nclones on Earth? They would have been paranoid thinking that all the\nlife that was going to be transported to Titan from the TET. was\ndestroyed and they were the only humans left, stranded on the planet.\n7.) One question I'm sure everyone is asking. Where did the TET. come\nfrom? Was it an alien-made space-ship and grew a terrible conscience or\nwhat?

                "reviews": "\nI'm a bit baffle at some of the reviews that praise this film. Yes,\nit's better than Jurassic Park 3 and its really dumb fun but some of\nthe praise seem bit robotic, like they are going through talking points\ngiven by a press agent. Nostalgic? Because this movie takes place on\nthe same island as the first Jurassic Park? Honestly, this does not\nlook like the same island but whatever. Bring back your childhood? Was\nyour childhood memory of Jurassic Park filled with cardboard cut outs\nas human characters, sexism, bad acting and an over indulgence of CGI?\nSeems so. The sequel that Jurassic Park deserves? From what I remember\nfrom Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, it had smart characters\ndealing with a moral dilemma about messing with the natural order of\nthings and dealing with the consequences of their actions. The only\nsequel in the Jurassic Park series that carried over the themes of the\noriginal Jurassic Park was Steven Spielberg's follow up, The Lost\nWorld. While The Lost World was not as good as the original Jurassic\nPark, it still manages to be a strong sequel that at respects and\naccomplishes what the original sets out to do. Jurassic World only\nreally has dumb characters running away from a monster bend on killing\neveryone in a amusement park. Again, Jurassic World is for a fact a\nmuch better film than the horrendous Jurassic Park 3 but that's because\nit's dumb fun, not the second coming of the original Jurassic Park."

                "reviews": "\nLet's start this by stating how much of a die hard fan I am of\n'Jurassic Park', I love that film, always have, always will. 'The Lost\nWorld' is a worthy followup, but at the same time lost the panache the\nfirst one had, as for the third entry, I'll overlook it because it just\ngot too silly for my liking... anyway, on to 'Jurassic World'. First of\nall, the positives outweigh the negatives by far, so to start I shall\nbegin with the flaws. 'Jurassic World' near enough scraps the use of\nanimatronics that made the original films so realistic in comparison\nand instead overuses CGI, but that aside the visual effects are\nstunning. And the story, well, it's a little too far-fetched to say the\nleast, but not to the point where it's completely ridiculous, just\nenough for you to have a laugh but still enjoy it nonetheless.\nTrevorrow's direction, Pratt's acting and Giacchino's score are all\nsuperb, and these combined make the film a worthy watch. The film\nperfectly blends drama, emotion and action, and when I say action, I\nmean full-on awe- inspiring action. The closing battle is just rife\nwith intensity, to the extent that I was literally sitting on the edge\nof my seat in the cinema, it was perfectly choreographed (if maybe a\ntad predictable) but my heart was racing, I hadn't felt that excited\nwith a film's conclusion for a long time. All-in-all, it's a well-\nexecuted and beautifully-crafted sequel, but will never outdo the\noriginal, the best 'Jurassic Park', but a second spot grab? I think so.\n"

However,\nin a way to have more people come back to the island, scientist's\ncreate a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction. But, like every Jurassic\nPark film in the series, things don't go off as planed and all hell\nbreaks loose in it's aftermath. Unlike the last 3 movies however, this\nfilm is made up of mostly new characters to hold off the Dinosaurs with\nthe exception of a small side character from the Original Jurassic Park\nfilm played by BD Wong, who to be quite honest is only there to somehow\nfulfill continuity from The first film to the new one. It would have\nmade more sense to bring in some of the original leads to bridge the\nwhole series together but that seems to be asking too much. The new\ncharacters starting with lead Chris Pratt are fine but underwritten and\nclich\u00e9. Pratt's character and performance is really the only bright\nspot of the new cast of characters but he lacks the cool sarcastic wit\nand intelligence of Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm and The everyman appeal\nof Sam Neill's Dr Alan Grant. Pratt however brings his own warm, comic\nsensibility that does make him endearing in his own right but unlike\nGoldblum and Neill who brought dramatic tension to the films, Pratt\ngets overshadowed by the dinosaurs once the bloody carnage begins.\nBryce Dallas Howard is decent but unremarkable in the uptight corporate\nwoman with no life role and Vincent D'Onofrio is OK as the resident\nhead of security of the park. Of course, there are two kids who plays\nthe nephews of Howard's character who are put in the middle of the\naction one it begins, leading to a predictable climax that while is\nfull of thrills, could have been seen a mile a away."

And you definitely can't watch\nJurassic World expecting a mind-boggling, emotional Inception type\nfilm. I would put Jurassic World in the same category as most Michael\nBay films, the story line won't make you think, the characters won't go\nthrough any psychological changes but you will be thoroughly\nentertained by the special effects. I think it's fairly obvious\nthroughout the original trilogy and this film that we are the visitors\nto the attractions, Steven Spielberg gave the parallel Earth a new\nunimaginable attraction, one which surprised the audience so much, it's\nrated as one of the best films ever. Period. Fast forward twenty two\nyears past the films of Interstellar, Lord of the Rings and Harry\nPotter, we as a human race have seen a lot of original, unique things,\na plain old dinosaur film will not bring us the same thrills as it did\nin 1993. Therefore we are once again, the visitors to the attraction.\nWe will never feel the same buzz as first seeing that T-Rex crashing\nthe gates over, or the same chill down the neck when first hearing that\nRaptor shriek. However, we can still be entertained. Which is what\nhappens throughout the film. The characters are fairly bland, there are\nonly a couple likable ones, but they all seem to grow on you near the\nend, the bloodbath that is left by the new Dino is quite emotional and\ngives you a side to pick fairly easily, the surprises throughout the\nfilm keep it exciting and the special effects, well we are in 2015 and\nthey did have a lot of money to spend so lets just say they are\nincredible as expected. If you're looking to be on the edge of your\nseat for two hours and trust the film to not bore you, then you have\nnothing to worry about, the line graph representing excitement just\nclimbs up and up, if you're expecting another Shawshank Redemption,\nwell please don't slate the film when it doesn't satisfy your needs. I\nthink that films should have two ratings, one for overall, and another\nfor it's main sub-category, for example as an overall film I'd give it\na 7.5-8, it's sub-category of excitement I'd give a solid 10, a\ncomparison to the first Transformers which I'd give an 8 for excitement\nand a 5 overall. Therefore I really do recommend this film for anyone\nwho like me, enjoys special effects, good excitement and two hours to\njust sit on the edge of my seat and thoroughly enjoy my time. I can\nonly say I can't wait for the second one and I'm sure you will too\nafter you watch it.\n"

                "reviews": "\nAs a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the\ngreatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their\nnames (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting\nthemselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my\nexcitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by\nthe idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the\nevents in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author\nof the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic\nis lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its\noriginal release, at least it's hidden very deep in the plot. The\nscientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces\nof DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain\nsurvival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the\ndinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a\nreboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the\nfirst movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic\nPark shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1\nseveral times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated\noriginal buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van\nthat they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John\nHammond told him on his death bed to \"spare no expense\", which was one\nof the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn't want to\ncommercialize the park too much. That's where the movie starts being\nperfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt)\njokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred\nspecies after companies, \"so how about Pepsi-Saurus\"? The movie indeed\nis full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos\nthat are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of\nthe movie? Mainly, I guess, it's meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date\nexperience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by\nthe Parts II&III. It's exciting, contains a little love story, it's got\nwit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that\n22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist\nand women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most\n(other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire:\nman and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That's probably why\nI'd give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park\nmovie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass\nwill probably never be outperformed. R\u00e9sum\u00e9: Director Colin Trevorrow\nmanages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the\noriginal which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of\nits role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur\nuniverse that we, the fans, truly deserved.\n"

Finally, as this movie states, \"No one's\nimpressed with dinosaurs anymore.\" But JURASSIC WORLD shows us that the\naverage T-Rex must eat 30 or 40 people daily to survive. Since China\nand India each have a billion folks to spare, plus umpteen millions of\nexcess Americans, soon we can expect an internet gold mine to be in\noperation live-streaming the daily arrival of 20,000 \"Guests\" for\nfeeding time on a real JURASSIC WORLD island.\n"

Spielberg\nhas gotten a hold of Chris Pratt's \"All The Harrison Ford Roles\" reel\n(the Solo vest, the close calls with closing gates...)and helped some\nguys splice it with dinosaurs to make a movie. At least, I think it was\na dinosaur movie... it might have been a movie about family... or\nbrotherhood... or militarization... or god complexes... or hubris... or\nrelationships... or dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. They were the villains... or\nmaybe the villains were the military guys... or the science guys... or\nthe humans in general... or the adonimous rex... or the raptors... I\ndunno, but I'm pretty sure the T Rex was the protagonist. Bold move not\nintroducing the protag until the third act. In a film that was\nbasically \"cinemasins\" bait, prepare for unexplained explosions and\nplot developments that somehow don't develop the plot (like... why did\nit matter about it being part raptor? Why was that a big reveal). On an\nisland in south America, run by a middle eastern guy, everyone working\nand visiting will be white and American. Watch one woman shoot and kill\na dino eating a man and immediately hear \"wow, your boyfriend is\nbadass.\" But don't worry, feminists, she'll outrun a T Rex in high\nheels later. (Yeah. Get in real tight on those high heels). Watch as\nChris Pratt's \"funny bumbling dude\" persona is stripped from him and\nhanded to Jake Johnson and replaced with a fake tan and an ability to\nemote using only his eyelids. Enjoy the nostalgia like the original DNA\nanimation, the ageless scientist, and the entire park from the first\nmovie which has just been left there to rot for some reason. Revel in\nfear at the ADONOMOUS REX, a dino with so many undefined powers, it\neven manages to change it's scale throughout the movie. Then sit and\nreflect that you just contributed 20 bucks to that movie's gross and\nnotice the blatant sequel set ups. *sigh* where's Goldbloom when you\nneed him?

                "reviews": "\nJurassic World was truly one of the worst films I have seen in my 25\nyears of life, and millions of minutes of film has crossed my eyes. The\nacting was wooden, the characters at best forgettable and at worst\nannoying, and the plot line had the unique blend of idiocy and\nimplausibility now usually reserved for the Land Before Time franchise.\n(WARNING: HERE BE SPOILERS) We begin with the story of Zack and Gray,\nwho go to the now famous theme park Jurassic World to visit their aunt.\nIt's never actually explained how their American middle-class parents\nactually afford two first class plane tickets to Costa Rica just so\ntheir kids can see their aunt. It's just assumed it's on the absentee\naunt's bill. Gray is your typical kid, bouncing like a madman from one\nridiculous event to the next. JW is a gigantic theme park consuming\nmost of Isla Nublar, where JP was created. This multi-billion dollar\nfacility boasts interactive holograms of each dinosaur species in the\npark, a research laboratory that made this aspiring zoologist weak at\nthe knees, and a thriving population of both herbivores and carnivores.\nThere is a petting zoo where kids can ride baby trikes and apatasauri,\na SeaWorld-like arena where a Mosasaur is spoon-fed great white sharks,\nand giant hamster balls where visitors can wheel themselves through a\ngigantic field of herbivores. Zack gleefully informs us that JW has\nover a dozen herbivore species and roughly 10 carnivore species.\nUnfortunately, we never get to see most of these species during the\npair's jog through the park. We witness at most 5 herbivores\n(Triceratops, Apatasaurus, Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus, and\nAnklyosaurus are the ones I can recall) and 5 carnivore species\nincluding the Indominus Rex (Pteranodons, Dimorphodons, I.D.,\nTyrannosaurus, and Velociraptor). It is never explained HOW InGen, the\ninfamous soulless corporation that refuses to learn from its mistakes,\ngot running again after the incident in San Francisco. It's stated that\nthe original JP event happened twenty years ago, which meant that\nJurassic World must have started construction only a year or two after\nJP: III. It is not mentioned how they got control of the island (we saw\nhow well a dying company's last ditch effort worked in The Lost World),\nor how they even got funding. Their shareholders, realistically, dumped\nthem like so much cow dung after JP\u0085and if they hadn't then, they would\nhave after The Lost World. The company should have been going through a\nterrific melt-down of assets during JP: III, and be nonexistent by\nJurassic World. Even with the Marani corporation bailing them out, the\npublic should have avoided any new dinosaur theme park like the plague.\nSo we're left in wonderment as to how this highly advanced, popular\ntheme park Jurassic World was even constructed. In roughly 16 years,\nthe public has completely forgotten the dangerous islands and now\ntreats the viewing of a Stegosaurus akin to seeing an elephant in a\nzoo. Given the public's long memory of even a single animal incident\nsuch as Steve Irwin's death, this is extremely difficult to believe and\nwe are given no explanation as to how this came about. It simply is.\nEnter a wooden Chris Pratt, an ex-Marine who inexplicably has a rather\nadvanced view on animal behavior. He treats 4 raptors, named Delta,\nCharlie, Echo, and Blue, like large dogs. He tells them to \"stop it\",\nand wags his finger at their snapping and snarling like we would at a\ndisobedient horse. These raptors are quite possibly the worst design in\nJP history. The CGI looks cartoonish instead of terrifying, and the\nraptors don't move or act the same way we've become accustomed to. They\ndon't bob their heads like birds, they don't raise their tails high up\nin the air due to bird hips, they're more muscular rather than slender\nand fast with beefy heads and necks, and they parrot sound effects that\nare obviously cannibalized from the other films. While this last is\ntrue of the other Jurassic Park films, it stuck out like a sore thumb\nin Jurassic World. Noises we've come to associate with attacks, such as\nthe \"scream\", are thrown in casually as background noise. The overall\neffect cheapened animals that have been the cornerstone to Jurassic\nPark, and made me utterly unafraid of them. Of course an \"incident\" is\nthrown in with a feeding employee yanked into the cage after Chris\nPratt's character finishes training them, but it feels wooden and\nover-the-top. Cheap jokes are thrown in at the hapless new employee's\nexpense after our hero saves him from his 4 pet raptors. Enter easily\nthe most boring human villain on the planet, a fat InGen employee named\nHoskins who is the typical Guns, God, and America patriot. He wants to\ntrain the raptors to attack America's enemies and sell them to the US\nArmy\u0085nevermind that said army was called in at least 2 of the 3 JP\nfilms to extract desperate survivors of Isla Nublar and might have a\nlong memory concerning half-mad jungle occupants. Chris Pratt is\nagainst this, and emphasizes that the raptors are wild animals and\ncannot be trusted as such\u0085before he affectionately pets a snarling\nraptor with its head encased in a metal restraining device. It would\nhave been a lovely time to use the gorgeous animatronics JP is known\nfor\u0085but instead we get Pratt awkwardly rubbing his hands over a wiggy\nCGI insert. In fact, there is only one obvious animatronic dinosaur in\nthis film\u0085.a dying Apatosaurus gently petted and sobbed over as it dies\nof wound inflicted by the escaped Indominus Rex (which looks like a\ncrocodile mated with a baryonyx and was the epitome of disappointing).\nThe hapless Apatosaurus ends up looking like a pool toy, with none of\nthe exquisite detail previously handled by the gods of animatronics\u0085the\nJim Henson company. This movie was worse than the infamously-bad\nJurassic Park 3. It was worse than Gigli. Save your money.\n"

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman \r\nfranchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, \r\namped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more \r\ngripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times \r\nthroughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to \r\nfight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if \r\nhis crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his \r\nfractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the \r\nhelp of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael \r\nCane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But \r\nthe real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly \r\nenemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack \r\nNicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. \r\nHe is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY \r\ndisturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime \r\nand Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original \r\ncast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal \r\nand more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a \r\nmuch better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\" \r\nstereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in \r\nfilms. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around \r\nmore so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly \r\nimproved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\" \r\nin addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the \r\nfilm an added frosting to an already delicious cake.\r\n\r\nSimply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The \r\naction is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud \r\nChristopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who \r\nsadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing \r\nin Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may \r\nfeel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I \r\nwill say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor \r\nhim in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a \r\nhuman being and father to his daughter Matilda \r\nLedger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his \r\ndaughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this \r\nrole and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented \r\nactor.\r\n\r\nRest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.\n"

We gain new \r\ninsight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in \r\nhis role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an \r\nhonest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting \r\nperhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.\r\n\r\nBut after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be \r\nviewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' \r\nMASTERPIECE of a superhero film.\r\n\r\nTo say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would \r\nbe akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.\r\n\r\nWhile watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is \r\nusually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not \r\nactually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical \r\nmusings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over \r\nin favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants \r\nto explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical \r\npace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to \r\ndo, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the \r\nviewer's interest.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of \r\nbig action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff \r\ngoing on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and \r\nthere's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.\r\n\r\nBut what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is \r\nbrilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first \r\ntwo-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down \r\nto the cast.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val \r\nKilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and \r\ncommitted as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us \r\nfeel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose \r\nit's pretty appropriate.\r\n\r\nHeath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and \r\nthought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? \r\nIs that what it's come to?

Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? \r\nBut...well...how can I put it...? \r\n\r\nIt seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, \r\nbut after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just \r\nlooks...well...lame.\r\n\r\nIf you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you \r\nneed to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.\r\n\r\nMaggie Gyllenhaal.

Why am I even talking about such \r\ngarbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She \r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAs does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away.

Alfred is the shiz.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. \r\nAbsolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath \r\nand Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular \r\ntalent. Go Gaz.\r\n\r\nEric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed \r\nentertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and \r\naction.\r\n\r\nI've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), \r\nbut this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.\n"

At the risk of\nincurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers\nan excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er,\nCOMMISSIONER Gordon--and it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine\nand Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted,\nlogically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and\nshould not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book\nmovies, it's not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it ain't so hot. The\nfilm's first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely\nconclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this\nbeing a summer blockbuster, there's another 70 plus minutes to go, and\nthe film's second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a\nneat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of\nbizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?),\nillogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he\napparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many\nass-kickings in too little time). I don't expect 100% logical\nconsistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and\nelisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolan's screenplay that\nutter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the\nfilm, we're expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of\nGotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good\nwork, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will\nend with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So\nlet's tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark\nKnight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and\namusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about\nthe nature of the super hero).\n"

I had my doubts\nwhen I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he\npulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked\nit's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of\nrunning about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking\nbut has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly\nconcerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next\ntime people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put\nsome fun into it.....Why so serious?\n"

                "reviews": "\nLet's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero\never, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel\nis made for an unforgettable movie like \"Batman Begins\" expectations\nare EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a\nfew words it would be \"152 minutes of pure awesomeness.\" Christopher\nNolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie.\nThe movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than\nthe comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people\nwho like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a\ncomplicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's\nanything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the\nending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved\nhimself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred\nPennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now\nanyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably\nwondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is\nflawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger\nportrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone\nwho has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath\nLedger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I\nhave never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of\nthe Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature\nfashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's\nsimply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted\nand he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even\nmore than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a\ndoubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations\nafter seeing \"Batman Begins\" will not be disappointed. I advise that no\none under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is\nrather frightening and the film contains intense action.\n"

Michael Caine just is NOT\nAlfred - butlers should speak much more correctly than that, and the\ncockney boy just doesn't work for me. Christian Bale doesn't seem solid\nenough as a Bruce Wayne. It's a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton\nefforts - there is at least daylight this time - and the plot twists\nand effects are decent, but I don't think they're particularly\nground-breaking.

Obviously the main reason I and most other\npeople wanted to go and see this movie was to see this massive whale go\ntoe to toe with the Essex and its crew. Actual confrontations with the\nwhale in this film were few and far between but when they happen, man\ndo they make an impact. This whale was ginormous, he was grand and it\nwas such a spectacle seeing this huge beautiful whale on screen. The\nway they emphasise his size through juxtaposing him with the boats\ngives his presence much more weight. Confrontations with the whale were\nintense and serious edge-of-seat stuff. The CGI effects of this whale\nwere beautiful and incredibly detailed. This would have taken up a huge\nchunk of the budget as making this whale look as realistic as possible\nwas crucial to the enjoyment of the film. Some of the CGI in the wide\nshots were well done, but there were still quite a few scenes and wide\nshots throughout the film, especially in Nantucket that really just\ndidn't look right and did take me out of the film."

Technically, it's fine;\nthe cinematography is interesting, the actors hit their marks, the\nsound is on point. But other than a few moments of nice humor and mild\nsea-faring thrills, the film lacks any spark. It's like director Howard\nand co. weren't that interested in creating an emotional, cerebral or\nexciting film, but more focused on simply getting the job done. The\nstory of 19th century whaler Owen Chase (played by an oddly-accented\nHemsworth), the influence for the literary classic Moby Dick, is a\nstory worth knowing. However, the giant scale and obsession inherent in\nthis tale is never fully conveyed, as Howard opts for computers and\ngreen screens, in lieu of the actual sea, to tell his story. So instead\nof a propulsive thriller or even a thoughtful psychological study, we\nget a generic and forgettable action/adventure, couched in boring\ncharacters. And much like the crew of the Essex itself, we are stranded\nin a seemingly endless sea of lackluster storytelling It also features\nsome of the worst cinematic framing ever. Instead of just filming Moby\nDick itself or just the story of real-life Owen Chase, they opt for a\nmessy mash-up, constantly cutting away from the Essex's voyage to a\nrecounting of the story to Melville; like bad narration taken to the\nnth degree. Even some marginally compelling moments showing the\nsurvival instincts of desperate people can't save this sinking ship.\nWatch Jaws, All is Lost, or Master and Commander if you want to take a\nworthwhile trip to the heart of the sea.\n"

The best scene in the\nfilm is of course the central whale attack on the Essex which we all\npaid to see, but even this scene is ruined by a need to make everything\nmore by-the- numbers and \"cinematic\".

                "reviews": "\nForemost, let me calm the purists of author Herman Melville's down: In\nthe Heart of the Sea doesn't have much to do with the legendary novel\nMoby Dick. Yes, the film is obliquely related to the origin of that\nbook, but it's based on ANOTHER book (In the Heart of the Sea: The\nTragedy of the Whaleship Essex, written by Nathaniel Philbrick), and it\ndidn't end up being one of those \"literary re-imaginations\" such as\nAlice in Wonderland (2010) or Victor Frankenstein. Having said that, I\ndidn't find it a very good movie either, even though it managed to keep\nme moderately entertained and didn't make me feel like I wasted two\nhours watching tough individuals killing whales. I might be\nexaggerating. We only see the crew of Essex killing one whale, and\nscreenwriter Charles Leavitt finds an adequate balance between the\nheroic tone of such \"feat\" and the remorse of such an aberration to the\nnatural world (needless to say, I'm absolutely against that activity,\nbut I'm trying to be impartial). Besides, the point of the film isn't\nthe hunt of shark, but the revenge from a huge whale, perfectly created\nby the special effects magicians and \"portrayed\" by cinematographer\nAnthony Dod Mantle, whose impressive views of the ocean possess such a\nconsistency and naturalness that I didn't care about which ones were\nreal and which ones simulated. In the Heart of the Sea looks pretty\nwell, and much more credible than the obvious artificiality of Life of\nPi (my apologies to the fans of that movie, but I couldn't swallow the\nCGI excess saturating its scenes). Anyway, going back to the pertinent\nfilm, In the Heart of the Sea accommodates the supposed \"true events\"\ninto an innocuous and predictable formula, starting by the main\ncharacter, the classic tough but sensitive cinematographic hero divided\nbetween his family and the demands of the difficult job he has to take\nin order to support it. Then, we have the corporative villains,\n(figuratively) hungry of whale oil, for which they finance the Essex\ntrip with a rookie captain, when it's obvious that our hero would be\nbetter qualified to guide the dangerous sailing. And well, in order not\nto reveal more than I should, that's how In the Heart of the Sea\nproceeds, with few surprises, null suspense and only a bit of drama\nduring the second half, when the story takes a different (but not\nunexpected) road, leaving the adventure behind in order to examine the\nevents the narrator Nickerson kept in secret for various decades, until\nthe curiosity and interest from Melville inspired him to confess the\ntruth. It might seem I'm revealing too much, but it's not like that. In\nfact, there isn't too much to reveal, because, as I previously said,\nthe screenplay is firmly based on Hollywood stereotypes, and Ron\nHoward's direction doesn't do anything to distinguish the film in any\nway, leaving the previously mentioned technical achievements aside. The\nperformances are competent, despite the characters being hollowly\nwritten. Chris Hemsworth is credible as the hero, and the rest of the\ncast also makes a decent work, highlighting Benjamin Walker, Tom\nHolland and the great Brendan Gleeson. In conclusion, I wasn't left\nvery satisfied by In the Heart of the Sea. As a sea adventure, I found\nit moderately entertaining but forgettable; as a \"man against nature\"\ntale, it barely wakes the slightest tension. In the first category, I\ndefinitely prefer Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World; in\nthe second one, I liked Deep Rising or the original 20,000 Leagues\nUnder the Sea much more. And in the context of Howard's filmography, I\nprefer Backdraft and Apollo 13. In the Heart of the Sea aspired to the\nexcitement of the former and the human drama of the latter, but\nunfortunately, it fell short.\n"

                "reviews": "\nWhale! Whale! Whale! You would think the inspiration for author Herman\nMelville's 1851's novel, \"Moby Dick\" would be amazing to watch. Sadly,\nthis 2015 biographical survivor film directed by Ron Howard, wasn't a\nbig splash with the audiences when it came out. For me, personally,\nthis movie was entertaining to a point; but the story about an angry\nsperm whale sinking a whaling boat really needed to be told, better. I\nreally didn't like the framing device in which, this movie is told.\nYes, it was mostly alright, that the movie had the whale return,\nmultiplies times after the sinking to show, how malevolently, the\ncreature can be, but this isn't 1975's Jaws or even 1956's Moby Dick,\nwhich were fictional movie based on true stories. This movie was market\nas the true-encounter that inspired the myth of Moby Dick. You can't do\nreally do that, if you're trying to be truthful, because it totally\nundermined and contradict the whole marketing message. For a film\nsaying, it's the realistic account of that story, it has to portray the\nwhale, more to what it truly is. A normal creature that only attack\nonce, not a symbol of God's wrath. This film wasn't even close to being\naccuracy to the real-life events of the sinking of the whaling ship,\nEssex in 1820 at all. I'm surprise, by this, because it's based on\nNathaniel Philbrick's 2000 non-fiction book of the same name; which in\nmy opinion was very accuracy. Several aspects of the story was indeed\nmissing like the burning of Charles Island & the resupply in Galapagos\nin this film. Plus, it didn't help that the film depart significantly,\njust to add a sub-plot where author Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) goes\nto an old mariner, Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) to get his\naccount of the events, despite being aware of the story from whaler,\nOwen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). It really seem, pretty odd that Thomas\nNickerson would know, a lot about Owen's relationship with his wife,\nand his boss, George Pollard (Benjamin Walker). It was a bit jarring.\nThe film's biggest problem over the entire film was the pacing. It\nreally took forever to get anywhere. A lot of the scenes were really\ndrawn out & quite boring. Whenever, something interesting comes into\nplay, the film sucks it out, by eventually abandoning the conflict;\nsuch was the case between how the ship should be run between Chase and\nPollard, or the will to survive between Chase and the White Whale. It\nfeels very anti-climax. The dialogue was also a problem. It was mostly\ndull exposition, with little to no character development in it. I\nreally, didn't get to relate to anybody in the crew, as much, as I\nshould had. I really thought, there would be great scenes that would\ngive us, some insight on who these men, are. The movie could also work\nbetter, with some inherent adventurous epic maritime life music to it,\neven if it's a tragic showing. It would really lighten this movie, up.\nIt would make the film, a lot more fun to watch. I love the use of CGI\nin this film. The whole whale attack really did stand out for the brief\nscenes, they had. It look really real to me. I also like how the film\ngoes all bloody and grizzly in its portrayal of how ugly, the whaling\nbusiness can be. Scenes like a young man being forced into a dead\nwhale's head was pretty interesting in its gory worst. However, it was\na bit weird for the PG-13 film to show that, but unable to show any\nscene of cannibalism during the surviving in the ocean parts. It seem\nlike it was a bit sugar-coated. What the hell, movie! However, I do\nlike the make-up work in this film. Some of the actors really did,\nlooking like they were starving to death. That 500-600 calories diet\nthat the actors had to do, was crazy. Acting wise, the film was also\npretty good. Chris Hemsworth was the obvious standout, he was able to\nshow off his acting talents quite a few times throughout the film, but\nstill it was nothing truly astounding. It's sad that he can't show,\nmuch of his acting chops, beside those Marvel films. The supporting\ncast was also mostly pretty strong, with Benjamin Walker, Tom Holland,\nand Cillian Murphy standing out. Overall: How does In the Heart of the\nSea compare to other tales of sea-voyage catastrophes? It was somewhat\nbelow average. While, braving storms, starvation, panic and despair,\nwill call into question the man's deepest beliefs, from the value of\ntheir lives to the morality of their trade, I never really got to\ninterested in the story to care if they live or not. While, this\nadaptation clearly had the big budget, it fails to connect emotionally\nwith me, like similar films like 2000's Perfect Storm or 2012's Life of\nPi. It's worth watching, but not much, replay value. See it, if you\nwant to.\n"

Chris Hemsworth plays Owen Chase, a husband and soon-to-be\nfather living in New England, who along with Captain Pollard, leads a\ncrew of sailors on a ship known as the 'Essex' on an expedition to\nacquire whale across the Atlantic ocean. In the process, the crew is\nfaced with a series of unpleasant situations including violent\nthunderstorms and an attack of a giant killer whale that leads to the\ndestruction of their ship. Faced with heavy casualties and plagued by\nstarvation, Chase and the crew takes some extreme measures to survive\nwhile stranded at sea in the middle of nowhere. This story is told by\nOwen Chase in his later years who tells the story to Herman Melville\n(played by Ben Whishaw) as he writes the novel. This film features the\nsupporting cast of Tom Holland, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson, Frank\nDilane, Gary Deadle, and several others."

However, I am able to\nquestion these reviews and the people rating it highly and not think it\nis just me but others, some of the things people are saying are\nludicrous. I read a review by a critic who highly rated the film and\nsaid \"this film will be of most interest to young children\" that is\npretty much the funniest thing I have ever read in a review, there are\nonly two types of people that could make that statement, someone\nwithout young children, or someone with a child as clever as Stephen\nHawkins.This film won't hold a young child's attention beyond the\nopening credits, the dialogue is far too advanced and is way beyond\nanything they could understand.So let's put that highly rated review in\nthe bin.Another review said it is thrilling from beginning to end, I\ndon't even know where to begin with such a bold statement for this film\nand how that can be justified, other than by being a review from\nsomeone who has never seen a film in the Star Wars franchise, or any\nother film in their life than City of Angels as the only basis for\ntheir comparison. Angelina Jolies directing and portrayal of characters\nstranded at sea in Unbroken was far better than Ron Howard has done\nhere in this film, and who ever thought that could happen, yet a top\ncritic with a high rating for the film praises Ron Howards depiction of\nthis scenario. So maybe I am not missing anything after all, the\ndialogue was bland, the action wasn't enthralling, the characters\nweren't fleshed out and their was no depth to them, there was no real\nconflict, there was nothing original about the way it was shot, and the\ncritic who highly rated it and put it on a par with Apollo 13 and Rush\nhas clearly never seen either of those films. A very boring film with\nno interest to children or teens or a younger demographic, little\ninterest to a female audience of any age range, even Chris Hemsworths\ngood looks can only carry the film so far for the heterosexual woman,\nso what target audience are we left with? Males 25 and upwards, so no\nwonder it is a flop at the box office. My job is working for a company\nwho analyses films main target audiences,and I can categorically say\nthat this film has limited audience appeal, yet I thought it's initial\nidea was to be a family friendly film. How did Ron Howard get it so\nwrong? I am going to be flippant out of disappointment, I have seen\nmore entertaining Persil adverts than this film!! Awful.\n"

Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved\ndog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones\nwho have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems\nlike a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with\nKeanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves\nto the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an\noverall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3.\nJohn Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger\nof action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this\nfilm and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the\ncharacter...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in\nsome utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it\nfor a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It\nis briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and\nkeeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the\nlikes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this\nfilm very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick\nby traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every\ncharacter is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be\nmore ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the\ncharacter and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far?\nHowever, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the\nmorality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so\nwith brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in\nparticular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between\nthugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in\nthe film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the\nsheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that\nturns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard.\nIt is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs\nespecially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it\nas well.\n"

                "reviews": "\nJohn Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up\nelaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes\nplace in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and\nit is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a\ncriminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people\nknow who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he\ngot out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful\nfor that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he\ndoes best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might\nsound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The\nmotives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are\nall very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's\nthe plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is\ndirected by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action.\nThere are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films\nand their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the\nfilm and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is\nthat we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of\ncharacter actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few\npeople then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem\nDafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus\nfor this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not\nvery chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe\nit is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a\nbit different from the usual fare.\n"

Great Acting, Great Actors, and I noticed Keanu is\ndoing a lot of his own stunt work in this movie, and had to do a lot of\nClose Combat Training for this movie, and future movies to come. I seen\nhe stars in Knock Knock a recent Sun Dance movie just released, but\nAkira is the movie I am waiting to see him in. This movie is great, and\nkeeps on you on the edge of your seat.

                "reviews": "\nAfter seeing and liking the first and the second part of this trilogy,\nthe third came off as a disappointment. There are only a few things\nthat actually work in this movie - Hathaway an Levitt gave very nice\nperformances, and were convincing despite of the ludicrously clich\u00e9\nlines they were given. Before seeing the movie, I presumed that (based\non the reviews I had read) they had only minor roles, but the two of\nthem guide the plot. Also some action sequences were well executed. But\nonly a minority of them. The majority was illogical and confusing. In\ncomparison with the second movie which I found to be, in its core (\neven with the occasional shabby lines), an intelligent and elegant\nmovie, this one lacks action. Of course that a movie shouldn't be\njudged by the amount of action, but in lack of it there must be a good\nstoryline. This movie has none. Its plot is full of gaps, frustratingly\nillogical. One of the things that induced from me a great snore was the\njail and childwhoescaped subplot. The idea of the jail is absurd. Whose\nprison is it, why are there no guards? Oh, I know it's inescapable...\nbut please. Its location is outside of some ancient city walls, but\nvery near it, and a modern complex is build only yards away (you can\nsee it on the edge of the screen when Bruce escapes \u0096 but I will get to\nthat). Bane (the Big Bad of the movie) escorted Bruce to the Asian jail\nhimself, made all that way just to tell Bruce that he will torture his\nsoul, and went back to Gotham, in the US, in the matter of hours. Why\nmaking that journey? It's impractical as hell. Furthermore, the man in\nprison, who are paid by Bane to keep Bruce alive (the man actually\nuttered the line \u0096 I'm paid more to keep you alive, when Bruce asked\nfor death), are helping him fix his dislocated spine (no, it's not\nbroken) and escape. Why? After a few tries, Bruce manages to climb the\nwell and emerges on the surface. He throws some big, fat rope back in\nthe pit. Where did that rope come from? Was it left outside just in\ncase someone climbed to freedom so he can free all the other prisoners?\nBruce himself had no rope \u0096 that was the whole point. Is the prisoners\nsafety rope actually tied at the surface? If so, why no one climbed the\nrope itself? Hell, my brother with whom I watched the movie actually\nthought that he threw down the safety rope to make sure nobody else\nwould escape. Then Bruce, with no money, no passport and no knowledge\nof the native language returns in the terrorist occupied and military\nguarded Gotham. He also, at the time, has no Batmobile, Batcopter or\nany other Bat-based vehicle. How did he get into the city? Fortunately,\nonce in the city, he found his Bat-copter lying on the roof of a\nmiddle-height building, a huge thing covered only with a nett, and\nvisible from air. With all the riots in the city, is it possible that\nnobody had stumbled upon it? Also, once in the Bat-copter, he\nencourages the not-long-ago buried police forces (who all have clean\nclothes and are clean-shaved after being underground for months) to\nattack the terrorists, but instead of helping them by shooting the\nenemy from air superiority, he lands the Bat-copter and seeks Bane for\na fistfight. Is this not idiotic? The only action scene that was good\nwas the one after the stock-market attack when Batman made a dashing\nescape. But, not even this scene can be compared with the ones from the\nsecond movie which were thrilling, masterfully directed and longer.\nThey were also simpler, there was no atom bomb, there were just guns\nand explosives, but it worked better, it was more realistic, and\ndarker. Unfortunately, what replaced action is load of parapsychology,\nthe endlessly recycled story of the orphan Bruce, with many annoying\nflashbacks from previous films. You know the movie is not doing well\nwhen there are flashbacks involved. What got on my nerves a lot was\nalso that all lectured Bruce, the man who sacrificed everything to help\nGotham and do good. Alfred was particularly pathetic. Bane is truly a\npoorly done movie villain. The comic book character is said to have\nsome intelligence. This was not present here. The opening scene, the\ndelivery of the plan of doctor Pavel's abduction: Bane has executed a\npointlessly expensive and complicated operation where he sacrificed\nunnecessarily three of his man, chopped up a plane and then used the\nalready seen skyhook (The Dark Knight), when he easily could have\nattacked the plane on land. The romance between him and Coltirald's\ncharacter is also redundant. His and Cotillard's background story could\nhave been left unexplained. Even with it, both of them lack motivation.\nThe rest of the movie Bane makes impressive entries. Actually a lot of\nthe movie is about walking on the street, walking through the sewage,\netc. And entering rooms. The romance between Bruce and Cotillard\ncharacter was redundant and not probable (I accept this only if Bruce\nwanted a quick shag after a long time of drought). The explosion,\nbeside the unnerving need of certain directors to explain in word what\nwe understood in picture (someone actually had said Explosion! after\nwe've have already seen the mushroom), was not realistic (no waves).\nBut, as a whole, the movie is sufferable, just don't expect anything\ngreat. The thing I hated the most is that Batman is missing from this\nfilm. Bruce was more out of the suit, than in it. Seems to me that\nNolan became a little bit too cocky with all the praise for the two\nprevious movies. It's a shame because the movie could have been a lot\nbetter if he hadn't.\n"

For starters, the continuation on the\nfocus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version\nof Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're\naccustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the\nemotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about\nfear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot\nstand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into\nbattle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the\nmantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen\ntime than before, but no less powerful."

Instead I laughed\nbecause two of my friends had indeed fallen asleep. batman does almost\nnothing in the first hour because he is crippled or something. How\nexciting, a batman who can't do anything. And I'm not writing batman\nwith a capitol b because this batman isn't worth pressing the shift\nkey. Catwoman is pretty cool. The problem here however is that she\nisn't really Catwoman. She's is just a girl with cool moves and a tight\noutfit. No cats anywhere. The bad guy is nice but the movie is so slow\nthat it doesn't matter. In the second part of the movie we see batman\nrecovering from a hernia just like that. All of sudden he is the man\nagain. However, this doesn't give you any real cool Batman action.\nNoooo just the same lame batman action we had to see (or sleep through)\nall movie long. Most of the things batman does, he does from some bat\nbike or bat plane which is boring. I almost forgot, the acting by most\nactors isn't really good. Most of it is boring, again. Except for the\nbutler played by Michael Caine. He's a good actor in most of his movies\nbut manages to make you laugh your ass off when he starts a sentimental\nlecture to Bruce Wayne. It's so funny when he starts crying and makes\nthe movie even more stupid. It's not that I can't take sentimental\nmoments, no. Believe me, it just looked ridiculous. And of course\nbatman needs someone to follow in his footsteps because well, he kills\nhimself trying to save the city. We can all see who's going to be the\nnew Robin halfway through but I remembered Batman and Robin working\ntogether from old series, cartoons etc. These two hardly know each\nother. I don't know if they even meet in this movie. I can't remember\nbecause I'd rather remember a movie that's worth watching like the\nfirst two of this series.

THE DARK KNIGHT\nRISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this\nmess.\n"

I suspect a \"we're only in it for\nthe money\" attitude for the creators of this film, but then again it\nlooks as if they tried but failed, and an expensive film to make it\nmust have been. Why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot.\nInstead of this mess. Just forget this movie and save your money, and\nyour time.\n"

Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi\nKnights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I\nwatched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George\nLucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to\naccomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And\nnow, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his\nentire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star\nWars\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace.\nI am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable\nflaws.\nThe evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet\nof\nNaboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch\nthe\ntwo Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation\nBattleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for\nour heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight\nface-to-face\nwith thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the\nannoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful\nQueen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her\nmake-up).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is\nbelieved to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a\ncool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match\nuntil his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a\nNaboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!).\nYou\nneed to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one\nyet.\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even\nattract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I\nespecially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the\nwondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To\nheighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during\nthe climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The\nPhantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee,\nI wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well\ndeveloped.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will\nbe a major improvement by the time Episode II is released."

For those who remember the originals, they were just as much\nfilled with bad acting, poor dialogue, and flat characters.  The Star Wars\nmovies are meant to be fun, nothing more.  and The Phantom Menace is just\nthat.  Who can deny the excitement of the light-saber dueling, the thrill\nof\nthe pod race, or the sheer beauty of the alien locations?  Too many people\nare expecting the saga's content to have matured along with them, but\nLucas'\nheart is still where it was in 1977 (though perhaps notably more\nprofit-oriented).\n"

The reason why I say this is\ncause George Lucas once said that every Star Wars film are intended to\nbe one big movie split into six parts telling a very complex story. I\nactually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't\nlisten to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is\nintended to be and how it's to be structured.

I\nwill admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative\nreviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some\nways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and\ntechnical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special\neffects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The\nscript is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire\nStrikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The\naction is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray\nPark is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better.\nMost of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as\nQueen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who\nshone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most\npart, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams\nwas outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound\nand direction are also impressive. However, there were things about\nthis film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals,\nstrong music score and good characters, the story never quite\ndistinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did\ntry to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further\ndisadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his\nperformances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do\nlike Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars\ngive unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even\nembarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some\nslow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe\ndisappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that\nvisually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox\n"

Many other people viewed it\nas a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn't\ndisagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital\neffects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome\nLiam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites\n(Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams' ever-wonderful\nscore, the complicated story (I won't bother discussing the plot; everyone\nknows what it's about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light\nsaber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It's obvious this film was\nmisunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too\nhigh, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the\nchance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the\ntheater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very\nsatisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don't do\nmuch of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really\nonly exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper\nto the original trilogy? He's just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a\nbreak. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of\nages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film\nwas very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs\nexceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual,\nwith more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the\n\"Phantom Menace\" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people\ntruly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of\nthe evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of\nthe picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once\notherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil\nsingle man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I\nloved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films\n(alongside A New Hope). I can't wait for Episode II!\n"

It's about getting\nthat warm fuzzy feeling in your stomach when the Fox Fanfare/Lucasfilm\nlogos\nshine on the screen. It's about having fun. None of the movies are meant to\nbe thinking movies.

They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the\nheart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script\nand direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly\nby numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard.\nAfter all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a\ndreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is\nonly an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off\nwith gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be\nsure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives\nhis all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in\nhis action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like\nmoving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs\nat almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme\nfatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very\nclich\u00e9d role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the\nchief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip\nSeymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery\nrather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a\nfranchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost\nin space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward,\neffects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?\n"

                "reviews": "\nThis is the first review I have ever done on IMDb...not because I don't\nlike watching films..in fact, I adore films. Rather, I normally don't\nreview just because I put a premium on my time, and don't want to spend\ntime repeating what others may have already said about a given film;\nuntil today, that is. In my inaugural review, I was very motivated (I\nmean incensed) to write this review now having come back for the\ncinema, freshly infuriated in the realization that I can't get 2.5\nhours of my life back after watching MI-5. I read glowing reviews\nbefore going to the film, to which I am now wondering if I saw the same\nfilm others who reviewed this film as \"highly enjoyable\". I am beyond\npuzzled how this film got good reviews, unless it is from reviewers who\nget easily bamboozled by special effects to forgive the need for a\nplot, or work for the makers of the film, or who are not of this earth.\nThe planet to which these people who did liked this poor excuse for a\n\"film\" I do not know. Yes, I knew it would be an action film, and yes I\nknew one has to suspend disbelief to enjoy a film like this, but\ndespite these prerequisites being in place in my mind going into the\ntheater, this film content was so vacant and vapid it boggles my mind\nthat I sat through its entirety and didn't walk out mid-film. The plot\nwas not in the slightest way possible to follow, and the reviewers\nshouldn't confuse plot complexity (which a good story can have)with the\nnonsensical incongruity of this film. Tom Cruise--who was truly\noutstanding in Jerry Mcquire,the Firm, Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut--\nwas hardly that as an international spy. Mr Baldwin--another\noutstanding actor and wonderful in the Royal Tannenbaums and Blue\nJasmine--but his role in this film was completely under-utilized. The\nother actors were alright, but its just that the plot and its\npresentation was just insulting to any intelligence. Endless product\nplacements for BMW, and then when the locale of different places were\nindicated when they showed in an areal pan shot its a bit much to say\nshow the US Congress and Washington Monument, combined with the need to\ntype in the upper right corner...\"Washington D.C.\", just to make it\nlook official and inform us that we are in Washington D.C. just in case\none didn't know..I can't remember if the pan shot of Big Ben was\naccompanied by the words \"London, England\". If you are looking for a\nsimilar action/conspiracy spy film with slick international intrigue\nwith believable characters, I highly recommend \"The International\" out\na few years back. In sum, please, save your time, stay at home and\nwatch paint dry for a more redeeming experience.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI remember when I first saw this film in theaters and the lights dimmed\nthe first thought that ran through my head was \"Here we go again\" as I\nreleased an involuntary sigh of apathy. Somewhere along the line,\nbefore seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the\noriginal four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt\nreally has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom\nCruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully\nfleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer\nelements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and\ncomplexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What\nseemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was\nsupposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always\nthe only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down\nto watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are\nextremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the\nplots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each\nelaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have\nremarkably similar story lines as well. Tom Cruise has a mission,\nsomething goes wrong, he goes rouge, needs to find some kind of\nMacGuffin, the villain is some kind of terrorist arms dealer, insert\nrandom forgettable love interest here, big stunts, the end."

Not as stylish as\nJ.J.

Cruise is\nreliably sensational as top dog and newcomers Rebecca Ferguson and Sean\nHarris are fantastic as, respectively, the femme fatale and unrelenting\nvillain, but Jeremy Renner looks bored and Simon Pegg overeggs it on\noccasion.

The cast was excellent\nand everyone excelled in their roles. I wouldn't have expected to like\nCurtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson in a role as much as I did. Jake Gyllenhaal\nand Forest Whitaker had Oscar worthy performances. Everyone did a great\njob with their roles. The cinematography was fantastic, and the fight\nscenes gave some great first person shots that made you feel as though\nyou were there in the ring fighting along side the actors. Overall,\nthis movie is an experience that is not to be missed. 9/10\n"

Both\noutcomes resulted in the death of loved ones, for Billy his wife, and\nfor trainer Wills, young Hoppy (Skylan Brooks) who Wills felt\nresponsible for and didn't do enough to protect from a troubled family\nlife.

Both Southpaw and Creed have reinvigorated the genre to a place\nof excellence, and while Creed is getting the awards buzz and the\nattention, Southpaw is arguably the better film. Creed is brilliant,\ndon't get me wrong, but Southpaw was just better. If you didn't smile\nwhen Billy knocked down Miguel in the last fight, or when Leila ran\ninto his changing room post-fight, then you aren't human. The film also\ncontains a lot of emotional acting which is usually seen in boxing\nfilms but not to this extent. The comeback of Billy Hope is as good as\nRocky, so it's a shame to see this film slip under the radar. It still\ncould get Oscar nods, but if every other award is to go by, Southpaw\nhas been greatly misjudged, which is a terrible shame. The acting\nall-round is excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal's physical transformation is\nbeyond impressive. It's a testament to the actor. While Sylvester\nStallone is rightfully getting awards recognition for his reprisal of\nRocky, Forest Whitaker is as good as Nick Nolte was in Warrior. With\nNick getting an Oscar nod, the same could be said for Forest, but it\nseems Southpaw has been written off for awards, which is a shame as it\nbelongs in the exact same boat as Creed. Both excellent films, they\nshould both equally be getting recognition. Southpaw is the most\nunder-rated film of the year purely because of Creed and Stallone's\ncomeback to Rocky. This is the only reason why. If Creed were to have\ncome out last year, or next year, then we would all be talking about\nSouthpaw right now. End of\n"

Tick also deals with\nhis own personal inner turmoil. When he finds out that Hoppy dies, Tick\nis venting and saying how he should have protected him. Tick then says\n\"God must have some kind of plan to teach me some kind of lesson.

However, at Tick's\nmost vulnerable and \"deepest\" part of the movie, he throws out the\nconcept that God has a plan. What makes Tick suddenly refer to God?\nAfter this scene, there is one more mention of religion when Tick tells\nBilly that God is watching him. What makes Tick mention religion?\n"

                "reviews": "\nReview: I quite enjoyed this emotional movie and I definitely think\nthat Jake Gyllenhaal should be up for an Oscar for his amazing\ntransformation. The storyline did seem to drag after a while but I\ncouldn't wait for the big showdown at the end. Anyway, Billy Hope (Jake\nGyllenhaal) seems to have it all, with his big mansion, beautiful wife\nand loving daughter, and when the lightweight boxer wins all of the\nchampionship belts, life really can't get any better for this man who\nstruggled through his childhood. He then gets invited to a charity\nevent were he gives a speech about his life and his love for his wife,\nMaureen Hope (Rachel McAdams) but his whole life changes when a gun is\nfired during a punch up with his arch-rival, Miguel \"Magic\" Escobar\n(Miguel Gomez). The shot, mistakingly hits his wife, who dies on the\nspot, which leaves a distraught Billy Hope, to bring up his daughter\nLeila Hope (Oona Laurence). Whilst trying to defend his title, he\nbasically gives up fighting against his opponent and he ends up\nhead-butting the referee out of shear frustration. Now that he's lost\nhis title, it defaults a 3 fight deal that he has with a television\ncompany and he's being sued for the head-butting incident. With his\ndebts piling up and his boxing career in tatters, he turns to drink and\ndrugs for comfort and the depression from losing his wife, starts to\ntake its toll. He then ends up in hospital after crashing his car into\na tree, so the child protection agency are brought in, because they\nfound drink and drugs in his body while he was driving. A judge decides\nto put Leila into care while Billy sorts his life out, so he sells his\nhouse to clear up his debts and he gets a job in a gym, which he also\nuses to train. After much persuasion, he manages to get the gym owner,\nTick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to train him in his own unique way, which\nwill improve his boxing skills but his daughter refuses to see him\nbecause she blames him for being in care. He then gets a chance to box\nin a charity bash, we're he shows of his new boxing style and impresses\nhis old manager, Jordan Mains (50 Cent), who is now managing Escobar.\nHe offers him a chance to return to the big league by challenging\nEscobar to a championship bout but he only has 6 weeks to train and to\nget in shape. As he desperately needs the money to get his daughter\nback, he goes through some gruesome training with Tick and he manages\nto build a relationship with his daughter again. With his new trainer\nby his side and his daughter back in his life, he uses every muscle in\nhis body to fight against the man who was involved in the murder of his\nwife. I really enjoyed the intensity during boxing fights and the\nemotional scenes with his daughter. Jakes anger issues were performed\nextremely well and the love that he had for his wife was really sweet,\njust like Rocky with Adrian but I did find it a bit predictable.\nPersonally, I'm surprised that they didn't pick 50 Cent to play the\nboxer because of his physique and hard man mentality! Anyway, I enjoyed\nthis movie and the hero to zero to hero again, concept was well put\ntogether by the director. Enjoyable!"

In my opinion this isn't an error and it's set on purpose.\nProbably it wants to give the idea that even if he gets hit straight\ninto his face, he keeps fighting and trying, knowing that as in life,\nif you are there at the right spot and time, even if you might be\nbehind, you should never give up because you can have a great come\nback. More than that, later on, his life is taking a wrong turn and he\nloses everything, but again, he never gives up, he probably took a\n\"K.O\", but he gets up, fights and believes he can make. Another\nimportant thing this movie shows us is that, in life, you might be good\nin what you are doing, but in order to be the best, you need someone to\n\"complete\" you. He had his wife in his day by day life, but in his main\nactivity it wasn't the same. Now he meets the missing part and he goes\nto the top and guess what took him there...\n"

Boxing\nmovies for the rest mostly follow the same pattern (if you've seen a\nfew you know what I mean) and this one is not that different from most\nother except that the centerpiece of the film is not the boxing match\nbut what goes on in this boxers life.

The performances were all very\ngood with Gyllenhaal almost unrecognizable in his role. His track\nrecord as an actor is becoming better and better as he switches from\ndifferent roles to another.

I know\nnothing about boxing and all that is related to, managers, trainers,\nlifestyle, money, bets etc... so I had to \"believe\" what I was watching\nin front of me. The love of a parent, the love of a trainer, the love\nof a wife, of a friend, the loss of the loved one, the betrayal,\nprofessional exploitation and abandonment when you are no longer needed\n... and the aversion for oneself, until things start to find their\nplace. Not something you do not encounter in real life, right? Curtis\nJackson was a pleasant surprise! Mr Whitaker, again, has performed\nadmirably. Jake Gyllenhaal... a boxer's face telling so much under his\ntorn skin and blood. I would like to see them nominated, they deserve\nit.\n"

It definitely had funny, almost hilarious moments in\nit but there were very few of those. I can understand that one of the\ngoals was to create a refreshingly modern comedy by injecting current\ncultural trends and standards but it completely loses its grip on the\n\"comedy\" part. The consistent cursing ruins the dialogs and gets very\nannoying, and I usually don't have a problem with fowl language in\nfilms. Even with apparent hints of feminism, the movie seems to\nconsistently humiliate its main female characters in the name of\ncomedy. The plot is weak, to say the least, but then again it's a spy\ncomedy and that was expected. Having seen other works of Paul Feig like\nBridesmaids and The Heat, I was very disappointed with this one.\n"

Spy is not very good, it's barely even passable both as a broad\ncomedy and as a spy-spoof. I'm sorry but this stuff is the lowest of\nlow hanging fruit and even the most seemingly learned among you are\npoised to be hosed here. Its not completely your fault though critics;\nI get it. Melissa McCarthy is a talented star. The mere fact that a\nwoman of her, lets say unique perspective can become a popular cultural\nfigure is a sure sign of progress in a certain sense. Additionally\nhaving a woman as a lead in a genre dominated by hetero-normative male\ntropes is beguiling, but in the case of Spy it's not only a missed\nopportunity, its a ruse and not a clever one either."

                "reviews": "\nReview: I really enjoyed this movie! I laughed all the way through\nthis, far fetched comedy and the mixture of top class actors, gave it\nthe shock factor. The funny script and impressive action scenes were\ngreat and it was good to see the funny side of Jason Statham. Melissa\nMcCarthy plays a desk bound CIA employee (Susan Cooper), who guides her\npartner, Bradley Fine (Jude Law) through his various missions and\nsecretly has a crush on him. Whilst on a mission to retrieve a nuclear\nbomb from Tihomir Boyanov, he accidentally kills him without getting\nthe bombs location. The only other person who might know the bombs\nlocation is Boyanov's daughter, Rayna (Rose Byrne), so Fine goes to her\nhouse to try and gather some information. On his entry, Rayna kills him\nwhile Susan is watching and she tells Susan that she knows the\nidentities of all of the agents. Susan then volunteers to become a\nfield agent so she can take-down Rayna and revenge Fine, so her boss\nElaine Crocker (Allison Janney) agrees on her terms, as long as she\ndoesn't have any contact with Rayna. One of the other agents, Rick Ford\n(Jason Statham), is disgusted with Elaine's decision to put Susan in\nthe field and he quits his job and leaves the agency. Susan is then\nsent to Paris to spy on Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale) and she bumps\ninto Ford, who has turned rogue and has no faith in Susan completing\nthe mission. The next day, Susan sees an assassin exchanging Ford's bag\nwith a bomb so she tells Ford about the exchange and then she takes\nchase against the assassin, who she kills by pushing him off a balcony.\nSusan then follows De Luca to Rome and she meets her contact, Aldo\n(Peter Serafinowicz), whose and Italian agent, working for the same\nagency. She then follows De Luca to a casino but she's not allowed to\nget near him, so she goes to the bar, were she see's a man put drugs\ninto Rayna's drink. She decides to tell Rayna about the drugs, which\nsaves her life, so Rayna recruits Susan as her bodyguard. They then fly\nto Budapest, we're another assassin tries to kill Rayna on the plane\nbut Susan saves her life again and safely lands the plane. Rayna is\nconvinced that Susan is a CIA agent, so Susan tells her that her father\nhired her to protect her. In Budapest, Nancy Artingstall (Miranda Hart)\nis sent to keep an eye on Susan and another assassin tries to kill\nRayna, so Nancy takes Rayna to safety while Susan chases the assassins,\nwho turn out to be the CIA double agents, working for Rayna. Later that\nnight, they go to a party, were Rayna is due to meet up with De Luca's\nassociate Lia (Nargis Fakhri), so Nancy creates a diversion so Susan\ncan stop the meeting. After chasing down Lia, Susan ends up in a fight\nwith her in the kitchen and her life is saved by Fine, who faked his\ndeath so he can become Rayna's lover. Susan is then imprisoned with\nAldo in a bunker, were Fine tells her that he really faked his death so\nhe can get to the nuclear bomb. Susan and Aldo manage to break out of\nthe bunker and they go to De Luca's mansion, we're they are selling the\nbomb for diamonds. Susan poses as a double agent and when the bomb is\nrevealed, De Luca kills the buyer and his men and threatens to kill\nRayna but Ford appears, which distracts De Luca, so Susan can save\nRayna's life again. De Luca then escapes with the bomb and the diamonds\nin a helicopter so Susan takes chase and hangs on to the landing gear\nwith Ford hanging on to her. Nancy and Aldo arrive in another\nhelicopter and shoot De Luca but he isn't dead and he hangs onto\nSusan's necklace, which was given to her by Fine, so she unhook's the\nnecklace and De Luca falls to his death. Elaine then arrives to\nretrieve the bomb and Rayna is arrested, realising that she has found a\nfriend in Susan. Elaine then appoints Susan as an agent and gives her\nfiles for her next mission. The director really did spend his budget\nwell because he was able to get some top class actors, film in\ndifferent countries and have some impressive action scenes whilst still\nmaking the storyline witty and air tight. Jude Law proves that he\nshould be a candidate to play Bond and Jason Statham shows that he can\nplay comedic roles, so like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, I hope he\nstars in more movies in this genre. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie\nthe first time round but I doubt that it will have the same affect the\nsecond time round. Enjoyable!\u00a0"

However along with this change of\nstyle, the franchise was actually getting better and better with each\nfilm. Today I saw the most recent instalment in the cinema... talk\nabout action-packed. 'Fast & Furious 7' is a no-holds, over- the-top\nand mindless action film, but this aside, it is an extremely\nentertaining and fun film to watch. With an all-star cast and some\nbrilliant action sequences, 'Fast & Furious 7' is proof that certain\nfranchises can continually make great movies. The most notable moment\nhowever in the entire film is the emotional and respectful ending\nduring the send-off of Paul Walker, the film finishing with a montage\nof Walker in the previous six films, finishing with just two words,\n'For Paul', this is the first time a Fast and Furious film has affected\nme emotionally, and it is arguably the best in the franchise.\n"

If you are\nlooking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and\nviolence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in\nDubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars\nbeing driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah!\nWhat wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious\nand Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes\nwith a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez\nfeels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson\nis the worst, with his \"cool guy\" attitude and \"bad boy\" clich\u00e9\ncharacter.

                "reviews": "\nI'm not gonna lie! I love this franchise. Aside from the third movie, I\nenjoy each one of them. You can't ask for much more when it comes to\naction movies. This series has always been a box office attraction, but\nthe real story is Paul Walker's tragic death. I remember being really\nsaddened when I read about his untimely death. He had come such a long\nway as an actor. He was getting better and better, and the sky was the\nlimit for him. I was so pumped to go see this movie! My expectations\nwere pretty high. I'm happy to say that it not only met my\nexpectations, but transcended them as well. If you're looking for a\ngreat story, look elsewhere! This movie isn't about that. It has plenty\nof emotion and a decent enough story for this type of thing, but this\npuppy is all about action. I thought after the 6th one, they had\nnowhere to go after it. What else could they possibly do, how could\nthey top themselves? Well, they did it! In convincing fashion. This is\nlike 5 action movies in one. If you think you've seen it all, you\nhaven't! There are action scenes in this movie that I didn't think were\npossible. They are incredibly unbelievable and WAY OTT, but undeniably\nexhilarating. I thought some of the situations they got out of in the\n5th and 6th movies were ridiculous, this one takes the cake. It rarely\ngives you a chance to breathe! Just when you settle down, along comes\nanother action scene to amaze you. As an adrenaline junkie, I loved\nevery second of it. I'm not gonna list all of them, but I'll mention a\ncouple. One involves Brian and a huge truck at the edge of a cliff.\nIt's completely implausible, but I was on the edge of my seat! Another\ninvolves Dom and his destruction of vehicles. I won't spoil them, but\nthey are memorable. The acting is solid! Vin won't ever be known as a\ngreat actor, but he has a lot of presence and charisma. He is always\nreliable in these movies. Paul Walker is really good as Brian. I was\nreally happy with the tribute they did for him at the end. It was very\nmoving and touching. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) Is a hoot as Hobbs. It\nsucks that he didn't have as much screen time, but his crazy antics\nwere a blast to watch! Great lines as well. Michelle Rodriguez isn't\nthe Letty we know. She's damaged and vulnerable. I'm so used to seeing\nMichelle playing bad-ass roles, so it was cool. Jason Statham is a fun\nvillain. You know what to expect when it comes from him. Kicking ass\nand taking names. Jordana Brewster doesn't have much to do, but she was\ngood. As a huge Kurt Russell fan, it was a treat to see him again. He\nwas hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson do\nwell in their roles. Special mention to Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey! Tony\nJaa actually gets a chance to showcase his phenomenal skill set. His\nfight scenes with Paul Walker will get your adrenaline going. "

Altogether, \"Furious 7\" emerges not only as a cinematic\neulogy to Walker's ephemeral career but also as a white-knuckled,\nsuper-charged, adrenaline-laced actioneer. Initially, \"The Fast and the\nFurious\" (2001) crossed the finish line as an above-average, illegal\nroad-racing epic about an undercover cop that bolstered actor Vin\nDiesel's box office clout while it forged Paul Walker's career. Walker\ncarried on with Tyrese Gibson after a disaffected Diesel bowed out of\n2003's sequel \"2 Fast 2 Furious,\" but the chrome-domed Diesel gave his\nblessing to the chronologically out-of-sequence \"Fast and Furious:\nTokyo Drift\" (2006) with a post end credits cameo. Some consider \"Tokyo\nDrift\" the nadir of the franchise, but I contend that \"Tokyo Drift\"\nsurpassed its skid mark of a predecessor. The three sequels that ensued\nfueled the franchise with even more vitality. Not even Walker's demise\ncould put the brakes on \"Furious 7.\" Mind you, \"Furious 7\" doesn't\nqualify as an artistic magnum opus. Nevertheless, aside from either the\nJames Bond blockbusters or the Harry Potter series, can you name a\ncontemporary franchise with as many sequels as \"The Fast and the\nFurious?\" Whether we see an eighth entry, \"Furious 7\" has knocked the\nbottom out of the franchise. Wan and Morgan have concocted some\npreposterous high-octane stunts that defy gravity as well as logic but\nlook extraordinary. Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, and\nAsian \"Ong Bak\" martial arts sensation Tony Jarr augment the original\ncast and invigorate these improbable shenanigans. If \"Furious 7\" marks\nyour initiation to the franchise, you're going to have a blast catching\nup with the rest of us. \"Furious 7\" ranks as the top of the heap in a\nfranchise that has never throttled back.

                "reviews": "\nThe films belonging to The Fast and the Furious saga have been\nincreasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new\nsequel, while the screenplays have been getting more tangled and\napparatus in order to guarantee the numerous cast to have enough\nmoments of individual showcasing. Furious 7 isn't the exception, and I\nfound it very entertaining, while it elevated the level of drama and\nmotoring stunts beyond any reason or logic... which is exactly what we\nexpect in a film from this franchise. Besides, the sad death of actor\nPaul Walker's brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could\nhave never generated by itself. I think that, until now, I could found\nthe validity in the wordiness about \"family\", which has been repeated\nmany times by Vin Diesel in the films of this saga (I counted at least\nfour instances in Furious 7). I wish that this new emotional weight\nhadn't been due to such tragic reasons, but it undoubtedly influenced\nmy perception of the film. Anyway... what people want to see are the\naction scenes, and Furious 7 completely fulfills the expectations in\nthat regard, with a series of outlandish stunts which are totally\nimprobable but very entertaining. Screenwriter Chris Morgan found an\nappropriate balance between action and story, and director James Wan\nmade a fluid and dynamic work. Editorial comment: the quantity and\ncomplexity of the stunts displayed in Furious 7 are making some people\ntalk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt\ndoubles at the Oscars; and I think that's an excellent idea. There's\nundoubtedly digital manipulation in those scenes (erasing of cables,\nface replacement, general retouch), but there's still an extraordinary\nmechanic talent, pyrotechnic and logistical talent involved in the\nshooting of those scenes, something which would deserve a formal\nrecognition by the Oscars. There are currently two categories dedicated\nto the technicians who mix the audio of car crashes... and none to the\ndrivers who risked their lives? Ridiculous. End of the editorial\ncomment. The veteran actors of the saga do their usual stuff in Furious\n7, as it can be supposed. As for the additions of the cast, Jason\nStatham makes a perfect work as one of the villains, but the great\nDjimon Hounsou is completely wasted as the terrorist who wants to steal\na magic application of digital espionage. Kurt Russell brings an\nappropriate style and personality to his character. And the female\nfight scene between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey is inferior to\nthe similar ones in which Gina Carano was involved in the previous\nfilm. I don't know whether this saga is going to continue without\nWalker; it probably will, considering the huge quantities of money\nthese films generate. My favorite movie from this franchise keeps being\nthe fifth one (Fast Five), but I can recommend Furious 7 as a very\ncompetent action film, and as a solid tribute/final chapter in case\nthey decide to stop here.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI rate this movie 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. I think the word would be\n'The Awesomest' part of the Fast & Furious series. Great work by all\nthe stars. No doubt, this movie is a tribute to my favorite Paul\nWalker. Toretto asked him for one last ride and see it became his last.\nThe action part in the movie, specially the stunts were just out of the\nworld. I don't have words to explain how fast my heart was beating when\ni saw Paul jumping over the cliff to grab the car. I was just damned to\nsee it.. and I was like 'how the hell did he do this'. Hats off to you\nBrian. One thing which made us Indians proud too was the casting of Ali\nFazal in such a big movie. He was also very good in his role. All the\nstars did their parts very well. And I just love this dialog... I don't\nhave friends, I got family. What an attitude u have Dom... just be like\nit always. At last, we do know that we will not be seeing Paul in the\nnext sequel... it's kind of disappointing but he will always be in our\nhearts. Hell Yeah..!!!!\n"

Paul Walker (and not forgetting his driver who\ndeserve some love too) died two years ago, during the filming of the\nseventh film. This caused some delay on the movie, and the some scenes,\nincluding the ending had too rewritten again. This ending is one of the\nbest endings in a movie I have ever seen, and for me it marked a\nperfect conclusion to the franchise. I hope. It will make me furious\n(no pun intended) if they decide to make an eight movie. There was\nsimply nothing that I noticed during the film that can possibly trigger\na new movie in the franchise."

                "reviews": "\nReview: WOW! What an epic action extravaganza! This movie was\nshockingly brilliant because of the unique stunts and decent storyline.\nDon't get me wrong, it is extremely corny in parts and the one-liners\nare pretty awful but the action scenes were out of this world. Anyway,\nthe movie is about an assassin (Jason Statham) who is looking to take\nout the Fast & Furious team because they put his brother in a\ncritically ill state in the previous movie in this franchise. After\nlosing one of there team members to the assassin near the end of the\nsixth movie, they soon realise that there life's are in danger after a\nbomb explodes outside Paul Walkers family home. Dwayne Johnson also\ncrosses the assassin in his office were he was looking for the names of\nthe people who put his brother in hospital but the assassin came\nprepared and ended up hospitalizing the Rock, which put him out of\naction for most of this movie. This is when Kurt Russell enters the\nmovie and offers Diesel a deal to take out the assassin who is ruining\neveryone's life's. The deal is to retrieve a unique tracking piece of\ntechnology from some terrorists, so they can track Statham down and\ntake him out. The only problem is that the device is under high\nsecurity so the team put a plan together which sends them around the\nworld. The storyline was very well put together and the directors\nattention to detail was great. The amazing cars and stunts made this\nmovie the 5th biggest movie of all time and I must admit, it is well\ndeserved. You can definitely tell were the budget went whilst watching\nthe film, especially when there in Abu Dhabi, crashing through\nbuildings and blowing up expensive cars and the fighting scenes were\ntruly a joy to watch. The ending nearly brought a tear to my eye\nbecause of the tribute to Paul Walker who died whilst making the movie\nbut the director cleverly used all of the footage that he had of Walker\nso it seems like he's in the film from the beginning to the end.\nAnyway, this has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year\nbecause of the amazing action scenes and the great cast. Brilliant!"

Jason Statham was a Badass Villain and i hope he gets more time\nin Furious 8... And of curse we don't forget Tony jaa he was amazing in\nhis tow fight scence with Paul walker but unfortunately he die. and\nRonda Rousy also her fight scence with Letty was greet ... and the\nfinal tribute for Paul walker was amazing and emotional and the Wiz\nkhalifa song see you again make you cry and forgot the movie , and we\nsaw a final ride between Dom charger and Paul walker real car Toyota\nSupra ... So for me Furious 7 is the best one in series i know it over\nthe top but the Cars and Stunts and Action is the best in while.....\n"

From the first race of Leticia to the\nlast scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie\nin the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol'\nfashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw\nseeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family\ninto Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a\nmission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens\nafterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul\nWalker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their\nbrother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played\nher principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and\nshe looks gorgeous as always.

Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played\ntheir part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to\nher role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much\nnecessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was\nnearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable\nat some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he\nplayed his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done.\nThe franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the\nfilm to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel\nfor him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,\"It's\nnever Goodbye\" and when they separate in cross roads, it was really\namazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker."

Rorschach begins investigating and hunting down\nthe person that is responsible for The Comedian's death. Meanwhile we\nmeet another hero who glows blue, and has almost literally become a\nGod. His name is Dr. Manhattan, and although he has the power to save\nthe world he won't do it because he has lost many of his human\nemotions. The other main costumed heroes are Night Owl and Silk\nSpectre, who begin to fall in love amid the chaos of their secret\nlives.

Never compromise.\"-Rorschach\nWhile Rorschach's (Jackie Earle Haley) proclamation may be possible to\nuphold as a superhero, the refusal to compromise on behalf of the\nfilmmaker in the process of literary adaptation is impossible. As film\ntheorist Andr\u00e9 Bazin wrote, \"Faithfulness to form, literary or\notherwise, is illusory: what matters is the equivalence in meaning of\nthe forms.\" In other words, Bazin is arguing that each medium has its\nown modes of representation, thus the struggle for formal fidelity is a\nlost cause and that the main objective is that the adaptation should\ncapture the original work's essence. Bazin continues, stating, \"All it\ntakes is for the filmmakers to have enough visual imagination to create\nthe cinematic equivalent of the style of the original.\" Zach Snyder's\n(\"300\") attempt to adapt Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's \"Watchmen\"\n(1986-1987) is compromised but that is the only possible way an\nadaptation can work as a film. He captures the Bazinian essence of\nMoore and Gibbon's work, a deconstruction of the superhero mythos, with\nan aesthetic that also captures much of the style of the original\ngraphic novel (to the degree it is possible in film). Will die-hard\nfans be disappointed? No doubt, but quite unjustly. Even with Snyder's\ncompromised ending, which ultimately can be interpreted as being more\ndevastating than the climax concocted by Moore and Gibbons (although\nthe film lacks a sequence on par with the opening pages of the comic's\ntwelfth volume), Snyder's ambitious attempt is the best that could be\ndone in a feature film."

This is the problem: you fans of the\nbook come to the movie already caring about the characters, while\nmovie-goers depend upon the movie alone to give them a reason to care\nabout the characters and the world they live in. (Which brings me to\nanother problem: no one cares about saving the seamy rightwing version\nof the infinitely corrupt world of the 1980s. If that negative fascist\nfantasy dies in an explosion, good riddance. Isn't that the fulfilment\nof the rightist fantasy?) The movie fails mostly on this count, though\nthere are other weaknesses. (I'm talking to you, slo-mo spacecraft sex\nscene.) I found myself caring only about Rohrschach (well-acted by\nHaley). The big blue guy did not seem to have any real dilemmas and\nabsolutely no emotional depth, the diabolical plan of the hero-villain\nwas obscure until it was revealed and too late to care, and nothing\nlost seemed worth shedding a tear for. As for the rest of the world and\nthe characters, I just could not wait for the impending nuclear\nholocaust because then I would be able to go home. And I'm actually a\nvery peaceable person who in real life doesn't wish instant\nvaporization on anyone. Several people left early, which I have never\nseen in a movie theater before. (I guess I've never been to a movie\nthat spent this many hours being bad.) In sum, worth the money only if\nyou love all things Watchmen and, perhaps, if you really liked Forest\nGump and Moonraker. (Having said this, I could have watched a whole\nmovie about the giant blue guy winning the Vietnam War. That scene was\npretty cool.)\n"

                "reviews": "\nMy initial thought after leaving the movie theatre for WATCHMEN was\nthat I had just paid ten dollars to see a movie which should have gone\nstraight to DVD. First, it is a horribly written script - dialogue\nshould do two things in film: reveal character, or advance the plot.\nToo many times did they have unnecessary scenes (the fire rescue\nfollowed by sex scene?) and dialogue which had nothing to do with the\ntwo points mentioned. The soundtrack of the movie was mostly songs from\nthe 60's and 70's even though the movie \"takes place\" in the the 80's.\nThey should have gone with a Hans Zimmer style of orchestra not the\ncheesy jimmy Hendrix all along the watch tower - it just doesn't fit in\nwith the movie (none of the songs do), this isn't Forrest Gump it's a\n\"crime comic book drama\" if you can even call it that. Again with the\ndialogue, too many times are they telling you instead of showing you\n(visually or through dialogue) what they are doing or what is happening\n- the director doesn't give the audience enough credit. Take a look at\nthe errors section for this movie, the list is endless more than most\nany other movie out there (I won't even go into all of those errors and\nhow bad they make this film). Terrible acting overall too. Roarshach\nlooked like a Danny Bonduce knock-off, and that mask he had was a\nripoff from Batman begins (when he puts it on and is like \"tell me what\nyou see\" to the doctor so dumb - trying to be like the scarecrow). And\nBilly Crudip the best actor in the movie we don't even know he's in it\n- because he's a blue guy with no emotion. Zack Snyder couldn't figure\nout if he wanted to make this like a comic book movie or a real drama\naction - and that really hur the movie. There are too many stupid\nlittle fight scenes that have no point in the end all product of the\nmovie. In the end, you need more than a bunch of explosions and blood\nspilling to make a good film. Definitely one of the worst films I have\never seen. "

For crying out loud, half the actors looked\nbored just making it. Too many subplots (most of which come out of\nnowhere, and go no further). The only people I could suggest watching\nthis movie would be the fans of the original graphic novel. Maybe those\npeople will actually have a clue what was going on. As for the\ndirecting I'm not going to comment. I don't know what the film was even\nsupposed to be about, so I'm not sure if Zack Snyder succeeded in\n\"pulling off\" the original context. As it is he didn't do it for those\nof us that never read the material. In summary, the characters are two\ndimensional, the plot is dizzily boring and confusing at the same time,\nand by the time you get to the end you don't even care if nuclear war\nhappens or not (I was rooting for merely to destroy the miserable\nexcuse for Nixon)."

It's hard to not compare this to the novel but as a film it is\nbrilliant. Zack Snyder truly did the story justice. Look around online\nat where other filmmakers before him wanted to take the film. There was\neven one script where they updated it to be in present day and have the\nthreat be from terrorists. Snyder single handedly saved the Watchmen\nfrom a cinematic nightmare. He had the script reworked into the closest\nadaptation of any graphic novel to date. I would like to shake his hand\nand thank him for being one of the few filmmakers these days that\nactually cares about being faithful to the source material of film\nadaptations. Beyond being faithful, Snyder brought an amazing style and\nvision to the project. He brought an independent film sensibility to a\nbig budget picture which not many people have the guts to do. I don't\nthink enough can be said on what a great job he did. "

Other than a hint of Film-Noir murder mystery and some\nsudo intellectual babbling by the giant blue Smurf who's genitalia seem\nto make their appearance with ever increasing frequency for no apparent\nreason. Gratuitous sex scenes that appear with all the grace of a 70's\n\"b\" grade porn flick. Graphic violence for the sake of violence. Seemed\nforced or maybe added just to keep you from falling asleep. Oh and\nhere's an original story, Earth must be saved, humans are the problem.\nAnd the attempt to revive the whole \"assured nuclear destruction\" was\nlaughable and forced. Played out like an after-school special. Maybe\nthat's why they had to make the present day 1985 like it was an\nafterthought. Now one thing that screamed out very early was the\nconstant preaching and tired liberal BS. Dear God, Nixon was elected\nfor a third term. Even jabs at Reagan couldn't be escaped in the\nclosing minutes. The portrayal of Nixon on screen was an unforgivable\nprancing caricature. It's as if a group of aging liberal hippies who\nfantasize and relive the glory days of Watergate, fired up their old\nbong and spit out this entire script. The constant jabs and digs at\nrepublicans and/or conservative values was beyond obvious and was\ndownright annoying after the first 20 mins. Tune in for dozens more\nspattered throughout what is almost 3 hours. Finally, the one shining\nlight in this movie was the performance of Jackie Earle Haley as\nRorschach. Of course he sounded like a conservative so they had to kill\nhim off before the movie ended. Figures.\n"

Oh, and Rorschach and a few\nsmaller characters were OK too, but not \"special\" enough to make the\nwhole movie great. The naked love scenes did not really add to the\nstory, but I guess the teenage boys love those. Since I'm home with a\ncold and didn't feel like getting up to put in a DVD I was stuck with\nthis, and now I wish I had gotten up and put on a DVD of something\nelse.

Characters\nare stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one\nhas the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been\ncrammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes.\nThe story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes\naway part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why\ncan't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge\nflying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of\nthose. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read\nthis book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill\nthem in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It's just not\nthat great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The\nfinal battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a\nhuge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain\nthe majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There\ngigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry\nsome pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets."

First of all, I read the book and I\njust thought that they left out a lot of detail from the book, some big\nones too. But, the visuals and action is what kept me on my seat. The\nstory, I thought they did a decent job with, but if they sticked with\nparts of the story in the book, it would have been a better film. They\ncould have made the movie longer and added some other details from the\nbook. I mean, in the book, Henri and John can open the chest he hides\ntogether. They open it in the book, and Henri lays John down on the\ntable and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears\nas their planet, Lorien, and with that, Henri shows what happened on\ntheir planet the day it was invaded by the Mogadoriens, visually. They\ncould have put that part in the movie, I thought it was a somewhat big\npart. But overall, a decent flick if you have nothing else to do or\nsee. Check it out, I Am Number Four!\n"

It should be a good movie about aliens\nhunting down other aliens on earthly settings. Well its not a good\nmovie AT ALL. Oh boy is this one baaad...., this made me really\nangry... First of all, the main character is a totally unlikable little\nsissy boy. The actor has no talent at all he has like three facial\nexpression: the \"I am messed up\"-look, the \"I am angry\"-look and don't\nforget the \"awww I am totally like a cute puppy, are you girls feeling\nhawt already?\"-look and that's about it. Not just the actor, but the\ncharacter is unlikable too. He is supposed to be a survivor, a teen\nfrom another planet, who is super-duper strong and one of the last of\nhis kind. And does he have a sense of nobleness or class? No. Does he\nhave a sense of danger or urgency? No. When it is established that the\nsame race, which destroyed his home, is out to kill him, does he listen\nto his mentor's advice and stays home? OF COURSE NOT. He keeps whining,\nthat he needs to blend in and stuff. When an entire group of\nouter-space assassins are out to kill you, and they already killed\nalmost every single one of your race, don't you have more pressing\nmatters, than go to school and try to be the \"kool\" jet-sky flipping\nkid?.... For example, like... I don't know...Planning to escape the\nsituation? Train yourself for battle? Plan a revenge? Oh come on,\nthat's not so interesting for teenage girls......They want to see the\nUFO go to high school and jet-sky, because he is so hawt......So he\nshall do that...Its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to\ndo with your main character is blatant fangirl-service. Go ahead little\nfangirls get offended and rate me down for this, but this is PATHETIC.\nOh and if you want to make another crappy \"nerds and jocks and love in\nhigh school with odd girl and hawt boy\" its okay, fine by me, BUT don't\nLIE to me with a trailer like this movie had. The trailer promised an\naction packed sci-fi movie and 40 minutes into the film I had to listen\nto god awful dialoge about odd-girls photographing habits and even more\nawful scenes with odd-girls parents having little family dinners with\nUFO pretty boy...What the....??? I am sick and tired of these\nholly-jolly pink teenage love stories, please don't try to force them\ndown on my throat when I am promised to see a movie about aliens\nfighting for their lives. I could go on about how unimaginative all the\naliens (good and bad alike) were, or how this movie had the most\nawkward dialogue I heard in years, or how stupid it is that after UFO\nboys little light-show on the beach or in the class-room nobody really\ncared. In reality after a show like that on a beach at night during a\nparty, well it would draw much more attention and it would be in the\nnews for days... But why talk about these things, this movie flat out\nlied about its intentions and it is sad and pathetic.\n"

The horror elements is that the film is set in a small\nAmerican town (though it is noticeable that main street has not yet\nbeen destroyed by Walmart) name Paradise (horror films always seem to\nbe set in places with pleasant sounding names), the scene is generally\ndark and dreary, and the main characters are up against an mysterious\nforce that is substantially more powerful than they are.

I am now thinking that sci-fi is\nnot actually a genre in itself, but rather a thematic setting, since\nmost sci-fi films will fall into action, horror, thriller, romance, and\nI will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself (though\nit is probably better classified as epic)."

If there had been a countdown (witnessing the\nextinction of numbers 1,2,3) so we might slowly learn the nature of the\ndanger, it would have been conceivably interesting. Unfortunately, we\nbegin right with the title character, a plastic handsome blond\nHollywood type who has no charisma and less talent. I laughed aloud\nmore than a few times, and as far as I could discern, no humor was\nintentional. The only saving grace (if there was one) was Dianna Agron,\nwho made an appealing ing\u00e9nue -- very pretty, not exceptionally vapid\n(like the rest of the film) and conceivably talented. This is the kind\nof movie an actor would leave OFF his resume -- no one would want to\nadmit to being in it. Of course, choices are made by agents, not\nactors, and to some idiots this appeared to be worth urging their\nclients to accept roles. I've probably seen worse movies, but as might\nbe understood, I can't remember the titles. If there was an explanation\nof why the aliens wanted to eliminate the aliens who were already on\nearth, I didn't get it.

Miles Teller proves\nhere that his performance in Whiplash is truly a fluke. As Mr.\nFantastic, he struggles to sound like he knows what he is talking\nabout. Perhaps a little more rehearsal time and a little less focus on\nthat cheap looking silver streak in his hair could have benefited him.\nKate Mara as Susan Storm is about as idiotic as it can get.

The biggest shock here\nin this film is where all the controversy started...Michael B. Jordan\nas The Human Torch. Jordan's ability to be a badass likable gear head\nis insanely good. He's the best part of this film by far. If there is\nanyone that could single handedly carry this film on their back, it is\nhim.

Lastly,the film is a set up for films to come.It's\nobvious it is,so Fox can keep the rights.From rumors out there,it's\ntrying to set up sequels,which is true,and it's trying to set itself up\nwith the X-Men Franchise,which I hope not. Overall,the film was an\natrocity,just like it's predecessors,and the only good thing was\nprobably the CGI.Then again,it wasn't even that amazing.The CGI wasn't\nas good,as say,'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'or 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.\nMy rating is a 2/10,and it'd be a 1/10 if the CGI was a tad bit worse.\n"

Especially the back and forth between the Thing and Human\nTorch but there is no team interaction in this film whatsoever. On top\nof that Sue Storm isn't even with the group when they get their powers!\nIn a time when technology is getting better and it's getting harder to\ntell when something is computer generated or not how does a blockbuster\nsuch as this get away with bad CG. Fant4stic could have addressed all\nof the previous complaints and would have still emerged as a pretty bad\nmovie; above everything else, the biggest problem with the film is its\nstory. Not just that it's poorly conceived and not fleshed out at all,\nbut that it's told in such a lazy, haphazard way. There's the usual\nprotracted pre-transformation set-up that's been mandatory since Batman\nBegins, which runs for the first half of the movie and falls flat\nthanks to the poorly written characters. Then bright lights happen,\npowers are given, heroes are captured and\u0085 we jump forward a year\ninexplicably. OK, so things are going to look at how they've changed in\nthat time, right? Nope. All of a sudden the third act motivation \u0096\nheralded by the return of Doom \u0096 appears out of nowhere and we're into\na rushed final sequence where the heroes' first attempt to stop the\ndestruction of Earth actually works. THE END. That's it. That is the\nmost measured way to present Fant4stic's narrative. I'd say it was\nwritten for an audience with a severely short attention span,\nconstantly mixing up the status quo just to make things appear vaguely\ninteresting, but the short run time suggests key development points\nwere actually edited out, leading to such incredibly choppy pacing.\nAgain \u0096 an explanation, not an excuse. Fant4stic is barely a movie.\nIt's a bunch of vaguely connected moments cobbled together to 100\nminutes so it can qualify for a cinematic release; the idea there's a\ncoherent narrative with a flowing story between its vaguely defined\nbeginning and end is so contentious it's insulting.\n"

I think this is the last you'll see of the Fantastic Four in\nat least 20 years. The cinematography was amateurish throughout. This\nmovie looked like a college project movie in the 90s that was an\nexercise in practicing new CGI elements. But don't think that I'm\nsaying the CGI was good. It wasn't. Everything looked just awkward and\nbland. The Thing was entirely CGI in a bad way. I'm all for giving new\nactors chances to shine. But every single one of these actors and\nactresses not only bored me and the audience of the packed theater I\nwas in, but truth be told, they all looked like forgettable faces. It\nwas awkward throughout. The script seemed mixed up. The characters had\nno chemistry with each other and no appeal for the viewers. Also, the\nhorrible casting of the 'token black guy' as the Human Torch was a huge\nstep in the wrong direction. The actor playing him was just boring and\nhis attempts at trying to seem like a tough guy made me roll my eyes.\nAgain, the visuals were just ehhhh. I took my phone out halfway through\nthe movie and began surfing the internet, something I absolutely loath\nto see people do during movies and have never done myself, until this\nmovie. But I saw that at least 10 other people were doing similar\nthings out of boredom from the movie. At least 20 people, including\nfamilies with young kids walked out of the movie. I could have walked\nout but the fact that I paid to see the movie made me stay. It was the\nfeeling of being in detention back in grade school. Its such a shame\nsince the Fantastic Four is one of the more beloved comic book super\nheroes yet they've found it impossible to make a good movie adaptation\nof them. Maybe one day. This is one of the few movies were I agree 100%\nwith the critics. This movie is bad. I'm just warning you. Its not\ngood. At all. Go see Ant Man or Mission Impossible 5 instead.\n"

I check the ratings now and then the coming weeks and\nwatch the ratings plummet. What the hell? Could it really be that bad?\n5 Nov: Nope. Turns out there was an error in the IMDb rating\ncalculation system because this movie is a 7 at worst. Plain and\nsimple, in my opinion obviously. don't know what people were expecting.\nThis movie is like progressive deep house: constantly slowly building\nup, never really dropping. And I appreciate those types of movies.\nKinda like Full Metal Jacket (though I don't want to comparing those\ntwo) in a way. I wish more Marvel movies were structured like this,\nrather than the usual mainstream mayhem (which is also fun, but you\ncould balance the 2 and make something really fresh)."

As I said I only read a few\nof the stories decades ago, so my only comparison is with the 2005\nfilm. So in my opinion this one is much better. I never liked the candy\ncoloured tone of the first one, admitting that its sequel was better. I\nprefer the darker and more serious tone of this one. I also liked a lot\nthat the movie took its time to develop the character, making them more\ncomplex and believable - even if this has the word: \"sequel\" written\nall over it. Especially Victor van Doom who is not the smug, arrogant\nand selfish villain, but a good guy who has been betrayed and now tries\nto protect his new world, even if this means the destruction of his old\none. So to sum things up: I believe anyone who claims the movie does\nnot do justice to its origin. However regarded as an action film on its\nown it has everything I want: good effects, good acting, believable but\nslightly broken characters and an interesting story even if it stays\nopen ended.\n"

By comparison Cyborg (a REALLY bad film) got 5,0 and\n14%. So with these scores I was expecting it to be a disaster of epic\nproportions, the worst comic book film ever as some have referred to\nit...But halfway into the movie I thought well this is still okay maybe\nit's the second half. But no again, the movie never actually get's bad.\nI'm not saying it's fantastic either but biggest problems imo are that\nthere is not much spectacular action, some VFX don't look that great\n(but a lot of movies seem to have that problem these days -cfr San\nAndreas / T5) and Victor Von Doom looks like a crash test dummy. But on\nthe other hand I like the darker look of the film and the\ncinematography was pretty good. Most of the VFX shots are pretty decent\n(apart from aforementioned ones) and the acting is fine (if you think\nthat was bad acting - see Cyborg). Another comment people have is that\nthe whole movie is exposition. What they mean is that there is actually\nto much talking and not enough wall-to-wall action but it helped the\ncharacters and I didn't find it a problem at all. After they get their\npowers they feel a bit like freaks and in the real world that would be\nthe case. You wouldn't go off playing a hero right out of the gate. I\nhave to say I enjoyed the movie and it does serve (or was intended as)\na bit as a setup for future sequels but it also works as a stand alone\nfilm.

Somehow, someway Fant4stic reaches into the depths of\nawful superhero movies, and takes the crown for being one of the worst\nsuperhero movies of all time. Lets start with the lack of story or even\na simple plot. For starters, we really aren't even introduced to some\nresemblance of a plot until an hour into the movie, and even then the\nplot essentially boils down to Doom sucking a hole out of the earth to\nsomehow build his own planet, which is completely bare. Considering\nthat synopsis, I think it is almost safe to say that this movie doesn't\neven have a plot (or one that at least makes sense). OK so the movie\ndoesn't have a \"genuine\" plot, that been the case with some other\nsuperhero movies. It should at least have some cool action scenes or\nprovide some worthwhile visuals. Nope! I honestly can only recall maybe\nfive minutes of some actual \"action\"' and even that was happening, it\nwas absolute crap. There were multiple opportunities throughout the\nfilm to showcase their powers, especially in the scene with Reed\nRichards and Ben Grimm, but instead, all we are left with is crappy\none-liners. Even in the last 10 minutes when we get the big battle, it\nends up being a boring, uneventful, clich\u00e9, and yes crappy letdown. So\nwe've got no story, no action, no villain (I won't even waste my time\nwith Dr. Dumb), how about some witty dialogue or a couple of humorous\nscenes. Wrong again. In its attempt to be the Dark Knight of FOX\nsuperhero movies, Fant4stic is stripped of all the humor and campiness\nthat at least made the earlier Fantastic Four movies watchable.\nInstead, we get a dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn't\nevoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom. The\njokes are laughable (except there not) and just about all the\ninteraction between characters feels forced and inauthentic. OK. So by\nnow you get the idea. Fant4stic is an absolute crap-shoot of a movie. A\nmovie void of a plot, action, and OK dialogue doesn't even deserve to\nbe called by its name, hence the Fant4stic's. It makes the earlier\nFantastic Four movies look like The Avengers, and in the end, serves as\nan embarrassment to anyone associated with the film. And if you were\nwondering, yes, it is even worse than Batman & Robin. :0\n"

The one that came out\nduring the 2000's is one of my least favorite super hero movies I've\neven seen. I will say that while the new one is an improvement, it's\nnot saying that much. Fantastic Four is an origin story of our lead\nheroes as they try to do some interdimensional traveling and they get\nsuperpowers from the result of it. I will give it this, in the first\nhalf of the movie, I was actually pretty invested in the story. I\nespecially liked Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan's characters as\nReed Richards and Johnny Storm. There is some intrigue about the\ncharacters and what's going on with them. There are some things in the\nbeginning that I felt could be done better (Sue Storm came off just a\nlittle bit weird), but overall, I thought it was pretty good. While the\nfirst half I don't have too many problems with, it's the second half\nthat I feel that the movie just deconstructed itself into nothing. It\nkind of shocked me that when I think about what happens in the middle\nof the movie, do I realize that almost nothing happens. I mean, there\nare some concepts in the second half that sounds interesting, but\nbecause of the way that it told its story, it felt like the filmmakers\nwasn't really trying. It just feel bland, generic, and nothing of\ninterest really happen. It doesn't really help that the climax of the\nmovie is one of the most boring climaxes I think I've ever seen in a\nlong while. it just doesn't felt like that there's anything at stake is\ngoing on. The action is about as underwhelming that you could possibly\nimagine and the effects were cheaply made. It also doesn't help that\nDr. Doom was wearing one of the worst costumes I've seen in recent\nmemories. So in the end, the last twenty minutes of the movie was\nterrible but it's hard for me to damn the whole movie just because of\nthe last half. Like I said, I think the first half was actually pretty\ngood but it felt like that the people behind it just gave up in the\nsecond half and considering the production problems that it had, I\ncould easily see why. Overall, while I do think it's not a good\nsuperhero movie, I don't think it's one of the worst. There's not much\nto recommend unless if you're curious about the movie but, overall,\nit's definitely worth the skip.\n"

The world is going to end because\nsomeone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a\ngirl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the\ntwist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the\ndevice, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US.\nBecause we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of\nthe end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie\nexists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of\nthe continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking\nof, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a\ngreat story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the\neffects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for\nthe first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I\nsaw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie!\nAnd the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this\nmovie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7.\nI was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer\ndidn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick.\nYou have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well,\nand made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit!\nTomorrowland: Disney's dream on the big screen, and I LOVE IT.\n"

I have discovered from past experiences that sometimes I\nwill love the movie even if it has bad reviews,so I tried that with\nthis movie \u0096 and I am so glad I did. I have absolutely no clue as to\nwhy some people do not like this particular movie. I think it has to do\nwith the people of today and their spiritual vibe. Not anything\nreligious, just basic human spirituality here. This movie will be\nenjoyed by only certain people. People who's frequencies match. That\nmay sound like pure incoherent drivel, but trust me, it is far from\nthat. Tomorrowland is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.\nI have been around and have seen many movies too. Do not listen to\nthese negative nannies here on IMDb. I seriously believe that many of\nthem write negative reviews just out of pure malice. I have three words\nfor those haters:"

                "reviews": "\nA little bit of context is in order for this review. I had heard tons\nof reviews for this film before I saw it in the theater. People had\ncontinuously mentioned plot errors and complaints about the CGI. I went\ninto this film expecting it to be mediocre at best. But I grossly\nmisinformed about this film. Director Brad Bird has blown me away once\nagain. Maybe I have such a high regard for this film because I expected\nit to be worse but I still stand by my opinion. So I would like to\ndiscuss things about the movie in both a Spoiler-free and spoiler\nfilled segments. SPOILER FREE: The film is incredibly stunning in\nregards to the camera work. There is a long shot near the beginning of\nthe movie that was done spectacularly. The acting is phenomenal.\nClooney steps away from his Suave type-casting and plays a grumpy old\nman in a great, great way. The main actress is perfect for the role.\nHer sass, optimism, and overall presence on screen is captivating. For\na film that has its plot based on a theme park ride, it dawns a script\nthat creates interesting,human characters along with a narrative that\nfeels fluid and realistic (as realistic as a kid's sci-fi movie can\nbe). SPOILER ZONE: Most of this has to do with the complaints. Many\nwere irritated at the villain's motivation. They said he didn't seem\nlike much of a bad guy at all. If anything he was misunderstood. I\nagree and disagree with this statement. Yes, he was very misunderstood.\nBut in context, how could a super genius who was given charge of\ncreating this world be anything but misunderstood? It would seem\nludicrous for someone of that position to be a complete psycho that has\nno motivation to do what he does. His writing makes sense in context\nand although that loses some of his villainy, it makes the story more\nwell rounded. Complaints about the CGI have come from the same type of\ncritics: people who prefer practical effects. Yes, practical is\nsuperior in many ways, but that does not mean CGI in today's film\nindustry cannot be astounding like it is in this film. Nothing feels\nfake, only futuristic and glimmering. Some people confuse this with\nunrealistic. Again, the long shot used in the film utilizes many\nartificial moments that are still breathtaking and fun. (And to the\nreviewer who said Mad Max had better effects because of its reliance on\npractical over CGI, I recommend they re-watch the Sand storm scene in\nthat film and tell me the CGI on that didn't make the movie a whole lot\nbetter). Lastly, people who were confused as to the premise of the\nfilm. Why would all the world's best and brightest be brought to a\nplace away from the world where they are needed? This is a good point.\nOne that I find difficult to argue. The point given in the movie is\nthat they are surrounded by pessimists who hold the \"dreamers\" back\nfrom their true potential. It's not much of an explanation and the\naudience is just left to deal with the fact that this movie was based\noff a Disneyland ride. This is partially why i gave this film only 9\nstars. END OF SPOILERS Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. And\nthis movie is no exception. Some people hate the movie because it\nstretched the definition of a PG rating (If you're worried, then see it\nwith your kid like the rating suggests). Some practical junkies are\nstill furious because the jet packs in the film weren't puppets on\nstrings. What they fail to notice is that this film is a humorous,\nwell- acted, well photographed film that deserves to be watched.\nThere's so much to this film that is enjoyable that it can't be\nignored. Sure, it's not perfect. No film is, or ever will be. But the\nnormal lover of movies knows that films aren't about being perfect but\nabout having a good time watching. My opinion of this movie is that it\ndeserves 9/10 stars. Sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading :)\n"

                "reviews": "\nMost people shy away from this movie because it gets constant 1 star\nreviews on IMDb. really the hatred towards this movie just proves it\npoint. Without giving anything away I will say the movie is very\ncentered around this positive message of a good and bright future. Most\npeople seemed offended by this idea and tear this movie apart. But\nreally Brad Bird just wants people to get excited about the future\nagain, which I agree is something we should be doing. But people\ninstead say this movie is preachy and boring and sloppy and just rip\napart Bird's goal for this movie. Most people expect a totally\ndifferent movie going into it, which I think is part of the\n\"disappointment\" people are getting. I honestly think this movie is a\ngreat culmination of good storytelling and a good old ending that'll\nleave you inspired for the future... Or if your not me hating this\nmovie to death. Go into it clean, don't expect anything or take anybody\nelse's opinions into view and just enjoy Tomorrowland.\n"

Raffey Cassidy, a cute 12\nyear old British actress stars as a robot girl and holds the team\ntogether. They work together to get to Tomorrowland.

It will probably go unnoticed by most people who\nwatch this movie, however. It seems like the end of the movie was\nthrown together rather quickly in order to keep it at a certain length,\nwhich is a bit disappointing.

Opening scene is\nintriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story\nitself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such\nmovies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about\nwhat to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan\nO'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain\nof story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the\nmeaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless\nfor the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at\nthe forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great\nscenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring\nthis movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those\nHollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait\nsequel with great interest.\n"

He is\nimmediately welcomed to a commune of teenagers who have been struggling\nto find their exit from the world they've been mysteriously thrown\ninto--The Glade, a forest dominated settlement surrounded by thick\nconcrete walls whose only gate opens to an intricate and ever-changing\nmaze, one the boys suspect to end up to their only way out of that\nprison-like expanse."

And the sub- theme about society is dividing people into a\nfew class. Just mention The \"Harry Potter\",\"Hunger Games\" series, plus\n\"Divergent\",\"Ender's Game\",TV-series \"The 100\",\"The Giver\" etc. etc. Of\ncourse there are differences of those movies/series. But the overall\nbig picture is quite easy to see that Hollywood is into the \"youth\ncompeting for their life\"-kind of genre these years. Plus the placement\nis very often a society who put the citizen into a few classes right\nfrom birth or given when they are teens."

Anakin \r\nsays something like \"Oh perhaps I shouldn't have killed him lalalala, \r\nwell, well, nobody's perfect\". So Dooku is dead. But hold on we've got \r\nanother villain, General Grievous. Darth Maul was underused. It's even \r\nworse with Grievous only he's not cool. The idea of the mix between \r\ndroid and alien is great, however nothing of this is revealed. Grievous \r\nis just another stupid villain. And the actor that provided his voice \r\nfor him should seriously think about changing professional.\r\n\r\n\"Sh*t, I've already spent like 20 minutes of the film; I really need to \r\nmake Anakin evil now.\" So we see some more wannabe-sound-of-music love \r\nscenes where poor, poor Natalie Portman yet again has to fight against \r\nlines and dialog that is absolutely horrible. I pity her, she must \r\ncurse the day she signed on Star Wars. Not your fault Natalie, we know \r\nthe truth. Yes, Anakin has more nightmares and yes, it is shown in the \r\nsame bad way as the last time. And yes, the Jedi council that never \r\nseem to do anything useful, just sit and watch and do nothing (no \r\nwonder you all will die) appears in a few scenes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my, I need to make Palpatine subtly persuade Anakin of the pleasure \r\nof the dark side. Should we say like 2 scenes are enough?\" Basically \r\nit's just \"Anakin join the Dark Side!\" \"No.\" \"Yes do it.\" \"No.\" \"Yes \r\ncome on now.\" \"Okay.\" No wonder you could not persuade Luke.\r\n\r\n\"Aah I still have to kill Grievous. Well, well more time for my lovely \r\nfellows of the ILM to show their skills.\" Let me say that Grievous dies \r\neasier than Maul did and have even less screen time. Rubbish\r\n\r\nNOW COMES WHAT BUGGERS ME THE MOST Finally after about 2 minutes of \r\npersuading Anakin, Palpatine reveals himself to be the Sith Lord. \r\nAnakin's life is shattered, everything he believed was in fact a lie. \r\nThis is dramatic, this is the purest betrayal. How does he respond? \r\nSomething like \"Oh really, hmm, I suppose I'd better alert the council\" \r\nEither Hayden is the worst actor or Lucas the worst director. Poor \r\nSidious, I reckon he wanted a better reaction than that. And when \r\nAnakin tells Windu about it, Windu who has dedicated his life to the \r\nRepublic and to destroy the Sith? \"Palpatine's a Sith Lord, damn, well, \r\nwell, I think we need to catch him, you reckon it can be done before \r\nlunch break?\" Yoda was humiliated to a mere action figure in AOTC. Here \r\nPalpatine gets the same punishment. The death of Windu is kind of cool \r\nthough (thanks Jackson for at least making Lucas fulfill our wishes \r\nconcerning that scenes)\r\n\r\nAnakin helps Palpatine kill Windu. How does he react? \"What have I \r\ndone? I'll do anything you want (to Palpatine)\" Yes that really does \r\nmake sense. Anakin you may have a high level of midi-chlorians (yes \r\nthey are mentioned) but your IQ-level is about zero. \"I fight for peace \r\nand justice and in order to achieve those I have to kill a bunch of \r\ninnocent children.\" Are you playing stupid games with me or something \r\nLucas? Which person would think that way? It is not logical, it's \r\npathetic. Every single scene with Anakin is in some way illogical.\r\n\r\nIn the end we have the Fight. With mystical dialog and with a tense of \r\nbroken friendship and love? No we get \"fast-forward\" 10 minutes of a \r\nblue blurring light. And yes cuts from when the emperor throws chairs \r\nat Yoda. You read it right.\r\n\r\nPoor Natalie is made to say her final cheesy lines and is then allowed \r\nto die. \r\n\r\nDarth Vader is awoken; he really doesn't seem to care about anything \r\nsave that he screams \"no\" that is a parody of the \r\nscreams-of-no's-movie-history.\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\nThe dream is dead.\r\n\r\nLucas failed us fans, for him showing a 2\u00bd hour commercial of how great \r\nhe can make special effects were more important than conveying a \r\npowerful story.\r\n\r\nOn the night bus home a man clad in Jedi robes wept. We all felt like \r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis movie could have been everything we could have asked for. In hands \r\nof a better director, with corrections by a real writer, this could \r\nhave been a new TESB. Now we were watching a fallen hero. Not Anakin. \r\nLucas.\n"

Lucas gave James Earl Jones some of his \r\ntrademark magic dialogue for his return: \"Nooooooo!\". Thanks, George.\r\n\r\nI love how they have C3PO's memory wiped at the end, as if that closes \r\nthe plot hole. R2 would have been able to remind him. They should have \r\nmentioned disabling R2's ability to fly and somersault out of planes \r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nYes, this is the best of the new 3. It couldn't be worse than the \r\nfirst, which only avoids the title of \"Worst Film of All Time\" because \r\nit wasn't shot on film.\r\n\r\nThe political parallels are the best thing the film has going for it. \r\nHowever, I would like to remind everyone that \"If you're not with me \r\nyou're my enemy,\" has been said for a MILLION years! If you want a real \r\nlaugh try attributing anything to W and convincing them it is a quote \r\nhe came up with other than his malapropisms.\r\n\r\nThe flipping Yoda is stupid. I know some geek somewhere thought it \r\nwould be really cool\u0085but it isn't.\r\n\r\nIan McDiarmid gives a pretty good performance, but the silly faces he \r\nmakes while shocking people remind one why he is otherwise noticeably \r\nabsent from the annals of film history.\r\n\r\nKeisha Castle-Hughes with the tiny part is pretty funny. The best \r\nactress nominee walking behind the casket of the best supporting \r\nactress nominee.\r\n\r\nUmmm\u0085why did Padme die? She was \"giving up\"? When she had two new kids \r\nto look out for? Maybe if they had her give birth, have the kids hide, \r\ngo to try to win Anakin back and he kills her the movie might have \r\nactually worked.\r\n\r\nSorry, Fanboys, I know you are all ready to dive back into the pool, \r\nbut this was still stale, unengaging and trite. I wish Lucas had never \r\nmade these three. There isn't a single moment in the entire new trilogy \r\nthat conveys the thrills of the trash compactor scene in the first \r\ntrilogy, or the fight on Hoth or\u0085well, anything, even anything from \r\nTHX-1138. It's junk. If you'd held out after Episode 1 and demanded \r\nbetter you might have got better, maybe he would have given up \r\ndirecting like he did after Episode 4, but you didn't and they're crap. \r\nIf this is your idea of good then you deserve Jar Jar and what the \r\nmovie studios give you.\r\n\r\nSorry if this isn't a funny arch review but I found how terrible these \r\nmovies are, along with Lucas's systematic violation of our memories \r\nwith the pathetic changes he made to the original to be seriously \r\ndepressing. The man has no judgment. Why would Anakin at the end of \r\n\"Jedi\" reappear as Haydn Christensen? He would appear as the redeemed \r\nold shell he was when he died, like he did originally. Any fool could \r\nsee that except the fool with the control. Lucas makes studio control \r\nlook good.\r\n\r\nA friend said this and I agree: what do I feel about this film? Relief \r\nthat it is all over.\n"

The best example of this is that in this movie characters\ndie all too often, such as Count Dooku (like in the first ten minutes),\nGeneral Grievous (who was publicized too much but ended up being just a\nsecondary character), and Mace Windu. Another example would be the\nJedi; we get to see just a few deaths, and have to interpret those few\nkillings as the extermination of most of the Jedi all over the galaxy.\nAnd even as they tried to pack this one full, some topics were not\ncompletely resolved, like why some Jedi disappear when they die and\nothers don't. Also, the Wookiee battle is too short. Compare it with\nthe Ewok battle in Episode VI, which lasted like one third of the\nmovie. It just seemed like an excuse to cash in on the reappearance of\nChewbacca. The romantic dialogues between Anakin and Padm\u00e9, just as in\nEpisode II, are boring as hell. Aside from that, I was left wondering\nhow come in \"Return of the Jedi\" Leia says she remembers her real\nmother, when Padm\u00e9 died just minutes (or less) after she was born.\nAnother important goof in this movie, thanks to the horrible DVD\nrelease of the original Trilogy, is that Anakin never wore the Jedi\nrobes he appears wearing as a ghost in the new end of Episode VI,\nunlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, who appear wearing the robes they had on when\nthey died. I am also curious about why they didn't bring back David\nProwse to play Darth Vader. In this Episode he looks smaller and\nthinner than he was in the original Trilogy. All in all, I am glad that\nthe prequels are finally over, because I was getting tired of watching\n\"Star Wars\" go down the toilet.\n"

Also, Hayden doesn't quite fill\nout that Darth Vader costume. He looked about as menacing as the Vader\ncostumes waiting in line at the theater. I am finally convinced that\nGeorge has never been in love with a woman. The dialog between Padme\nand Anakin made me cringe every time they exchanged their horrid lines.\nAnakin: \"You look so beautiful tonight\" Padme: \"That is because I am so\nmuch in love\" UGH!!!

                "reviews": "\nTo preface this little review, I used to be up until a day or so ago a\nfirm believer in George Lucas, not only his movie making ability, but\nalso his ability to redeem what has been an abysmal trilogy. I used to\nbe one of those fan boys who just couldn't admit that anything was\nwrong with the prequels, I remember walking out of episode one thinking\nthat it was a great flick, but have over time become aware that the\nprequels have been nothing but a total letdown... But to be honest I\nwas really looking forward to seeing Episode Three, not only because I\nhad read that a lot of you out there actually thought this movie was\ngood, not only that but it made up for the first two prequels, and even\neclipsed a few of the originals. A day after seeing Episode Three the\nonly thing i can say is that George Lucas fumbled the ball, and let not\nonly the star wars crowd down, but the movie watching public in\ngeneral. It was sloppy, forced, and the acting apart from McDiarmid,\nand McGreggor was just lousy. What I thought was going to be an\nexplanation of how Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side, became an\nalmost agonizing countdown to the credits. Now before I bash the whole\nmovie to pieces, I will say that there were some parts of the movie I\nthought were great. The special affects, as always were great, the as\nsaid before there were a couple of good performances, and thats about\nit. Now for the bad, my first real gripe with this movie is how awful,\nand stilted the acting was. Portman, Christiansin, Christopher Lee,\nthose annoying Neimoidians and even the baddest man on the planet Sam\nJackson sounded like amateurs. this is surprising to me, because even\nthe worst one of them all Hayden Christiansin isn't that bad of an\nactor. I blame this mostly on Lucas' inability to write believable, and\neven tolerable dialog at all. Even the original Star Wars movies had\nthe same problem, but the actors pulled it off. This wouldn't be a\nproblem if it was only a small fraction of the movie, but for every\ncool, or good line, the audience had to sit through a bunch of crap\nthat just pulled the viewer out. My main gripe in this is the\nAnakin/Padme love story, and the hideous \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,\" that Vader\nutters near the end of the picture. Whether or not that was a homage to\nFrankenstein or not, that is something that should have never made it\ninto the flick. And what the heck was with Vaders voice when he got\ninto the suit. Props to Lucas for bringing back James Earl Jones, but\nwhy all the enunciation, did Vader develop an accent a few years after\nhe got the suit?? Another problem I had is that throughout both of the\ntrilogies, viewers are told what great warriors Jedi are, how all\npowerful they are, and how their use of the force helps them to sense\nthings before they happen. If this is the case then why is it that\nafter Palpatine passes his law, something 66, are the Jedi so easily\ndispatched. I can understand the little Padawan's being slaughtered,\nbut Ki Adi Mundi getting shot by clones without even a fight at\nall....thats just weak. The Jedi Purge is something that I thought\nwould make this movie great, instead its just a five minute montage of\nthe so-called greatest warriors in the universe getting pounded like\nPeter McNeely. My last huge problem is...Grievous. Why they even\ncreated him in the first place I cant figure out. He didn't do anything\nexcept cough, and spout out cheesy one liners for his short stint in\nthe movie, and then even though he's slaughtered countless Jedi, and\nhas been semi-trained in Jedi Fighting styles by Count Dooku, is man\nhandled by obi wan, like any of the other machines. Even his body\nguards gave obi wan a better fight then grievous did. This was very\ndisappointing to me, only because I was a big fan of the clone wars\ncartoon, and that made grievous look like a total bad a$$. Another\nproblem i had with grievous is the abysmal voice acting of whatever\nhobo they pulled off of the street to to the voice work. At one point\nLucas had Gary Oldman on to do his voice...what was Lucas thinking. One\nother small knit pick, Why was Chewbacca even in the movie, matter of\nfact why was that whole Wookie battle in it, it served no purpose other\nthat to make fan-boys soil themselves. I know this is going to just\npi$$ off every star wars fan that frequents this site. But to all of\nyou fan-boys I pose one question. If its possible for you, go see the\nmovie and just treat it like any other movie. If it didn't have the\nwords Star Wars in the title would any of you even like it?? To me this\nis just another missed opportunity for Mr. Lucas, and quite frankly\nproof that good old George is becoming nothing less than a self\nabsorbed HACK. I love the original Star Wars just as much as any fan\nboy out there...i used to be one of you guys!!! But after last night,\nand after Lord of the Rings Star Wars, just doesn't stack up. And if\nGeorge is reading this.... Mr. Lucas read a book, or better yet watch a\nQuentin Tarantino movie, maybe that will help you to write dialog...and\nfor anyone who still hasn't seen this piece of garbage, wait for the\nDVD, or better yet that special, special edition of the prequels that\nLucas will no doubt give us to squeeze the piggy bank. So...to close\nout props to Ewan McGreggor, Ian McDiarmid, and the people at ILM,\nbesides that for shame George.\n"

To those who say that let me point\nyou to Peter Jackson's treatment of The Lord Of The Rings, a story\nwhich the majority of viewers already knew what was going to occur, yet\nJackson still managed to create an exciting and fresh experience. Here\nLucas had the benefit that no one knew what the causes were that lead\nAnakin to his fall from grace. All we knew is that he fell. He had a\nlot more room to maneuver story-wise, yet he threw it all away in favor\nof visually showing us what new technological gizmo's he could come up\nwith."

                "reviews": "\nThe first two movies in the prequel trilogy weren't horrible, but had\nso many flaws. This one isn't as good as any movie in the original\ntrilogy, but if you ask me it's pretty close. This one is actually very\nwell done and special effects don't look so fake now and give us some\nreally epic scenes, especially in a movie's climax that will keep you\nat the edge of your seat. Here, George Lucas proved that he can still\ndo it and I was really satisfied with this movie. The acting was the\nbest the prequel trilogy gave and Hayden Christensen isn't so wooden\nand annoying anymore. Here he's actually pretty cool and shows that he\nhas potential, but Ewan McGregor remains the best part of the cast. You\nreally believe him to be young Obi-Wan and that's very well done and he\nalso has some very heartbreaking moments with Anakin at the end. One of\nthe biggest flaws in the prequels was all those political\nconversations. Just lots and lots and lots of talking that makes you\nwant to fall asleep, but thankfully, Lucas listened to his fans and\nit's reduced here. It's still present, of course, but not as much.\nRomance between Padme and Anakin is a little bit more believable here,\nbut still not enough and that's one of the biggest flaws here, but the\nblame is more on Attack of the Clones in this case. Everything is\nexecuted very well and leading up to the original trilogy is very good,\neven tho it does create some plot holes, but in Star Wars you can\nexplain almost everything with the Force. And one more good thing for\nJar Jar haters, he appears for only like, a second. Hooray! But there\nis one more thing they messed up in the ending and I'm not gonna spoil\nanything but that one awful line (NOOOO!). While the first two movies\nin the prequel trilogy were disappointing, this one makes it all\nbetter. Not everyone will like it, but as a big Star Wars fan, I must\nsay it's a nice and intense ending for the prequels.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI never expected anything more of this film than run of the mill action\nwith the Hit-man flavor. I was sorely disappointed. Firstly I felt like\nthe first hour or so of the film was a take on \"The Terminator\" with a\nbit of a \"Leon: The Professional\" vibe too. There was even an\nantagonist who had rejuvenating body armour like a Terminator cyborg.\nHe got shot plenty of times to kill him and even electrocuted but\nwouldn't die. Agent 47 was basically reduced to a supporting character\nand the \"sixth sense\" nonsense where the female protagonist learns to\nharness her own Hit-man skills is laughable. Throw in the old \"you're\nbrother and sister\" and you've got your classic 1am made-for-TV\nb-movie. However my greatest disappointment was at the end when they\ntake the HQ down and do all of this \"in-sync\" shooting with one\nanother, crossing arms etc... it was so cringe worthy. The only cool\npart of the film for me was when I accepted she had a sixth sense of a\nsort and at the very end where the female protagonist anticipated a\npowerful army or special ops team of sorts coming up the stairs to get\nthem, when in fact it was Agent 48. Then the film ended. It was kind of\ncool. I love Hit-man but was very disappointed although I do feel if\nthey ever make another one they need to have an actor who is\nessentially a no-name because 47 is so blank in the face if you had a\nfamous person playing the character I feel you would lose your\nsuspension of disbelief. No disrespect to The Late Paul Walker who was\nin talks to play the iconic video game character. Lastly I feel that\nwhat the Hit-man games are about; stealth and creative ways to execute\ncontracts is not what an action films wants which is full on\nshoot-outs. In the game Hit-man if you carried on the way they did in\nthis film (or the last to be honest) then you would lose so many points\nfor not being a \"silent assassin\" as he \"goes loud\" almost every time\nin this. The need to go Nolan-Batman, dark themed if they were to\ntranslate this into a successful film franchise.\n"

However, no\ncharacter development or an explanation who, why, where, when and so\non. Previous version had it all and if someone planned sequels (or a\nfranchise), they should have done it eight years ago. Then it would\nmake sense. Don't get me wrong here. This movie is not a bad one and\nthe cast gave it all to make it entertaining. But for me that is just\nnot enough, considering the template (video game) and possibilities to\ndevelop a good idea into a more complex and challenging story. This\nmovie returns all to the level of the video game (maybe even below\nthat). I think that these characters deserve more.

Except it doesn't\nstray that far from the source material. Audiences that doesn't know\nabout \"Hitman\" video games will find this movie odd for negative\nreasons. And the gamers that know about this video game franchise will\nbe left disappointed. Because the actor that plays Agent 47 does not\nresemble 47 besides the shaved head. And the way Agent 47 does things\nin the video game is very very different. Kind of like how Paul W. S.\nAnderson took a survival horror game into a straight up kung-fu action\nmovie with bullet time and people pulling off \"The Matrix\" maneuvers.\nWatching this was like watching a crappy version of \"The Terminator\".\nOn a positive note, maybe it's because this movie is just 1 hour and 30\nminutes but the characters weren't really annoying but they are still\neasily forgettable. The hand to hand fight choreography was choppy but\nalright as well. However I was just checking my watch throughout this\nwhole mess of a film, even though I try to give it a shot and see the\npositive aspects of it.

The first cinematic adaptation of the stealth\nvideo game series about a genetically-engineered, skin-headed assassin\nwith a bar code stamped on the back of his head and designated as Agent\n47 appeared in 2007 with \"Justified\" star Timothy Olyphant. Sources\nindicate that the $25-million budgeted actioneer raked in about\n$150-million at the box office. Mind you, Hollywood has produced\nsequels from less successful originals so it seems mysterious that\nTwentieth Century Fox has stalled a sequel for so long. Actually, I\nthought director Xavier Gens's fast-paced but formulaic \"Hitman\"\nqualified as bottom-of-the-barrel abysmal. Despite its strong cast and\nslick production values, the unrated DVD/Blu-ray \"Hitman\" release has\ndone nothing to alter my sentiments. Consequently, I approached\ndirector Aleksander Bach's sequel \"Hitman: Agent 47\" with dread.\nReportedly, \"Fast and Furious\" star Paul Walker had been attached to\nstar in this shoot'em up saga before he died in a fiery car crash.\nBritish thespian Rupert Friend of \"Homeland\" fame takes over the role\nfrom Timothy Olyphant. Friend adopts the skin-head look and delivers a\nperformance every bit as imperturbable as Olyphant. Surprisingly\nenough, however, \"Hitman: Agent 47\" turned out a 100 times better than\nits lackluster predecessor. As far as pistol-packing suspense thrillers\ngo, \"Hitman: Agent 47\" (**** OUT OF ****) ranks as one of the\npreeminent summer actioneers. I found myself entirely caught off guard\nby this sensational shoot'em up. Stunning Berlin and Singapore scenery,\nspontaneous combat sequences, a double-digit body count, and story\nsurprises galore distinguish this lean, mean, 97 minute, R-rated,\nbullet-riddled bloodbath about a daughter searching for her long-lost\nfather. Granted, movies about cloned, super-assassins have become a\ndime-a-dozen, but \"Hitman: Agent 47\" looms above all others with its\nimaginative Skip Woods and Michael Finch script and Bach's ambitiously,\noutlandish showdowns. If you love stimulating action movies, you'll\nappreciate this gripping movie that co-stars Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Thomas\nKretschmann, Zachary Quinto, and J\u00fcrgen Prochnow.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT \r\nMOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it \r\nmay just be the best comic book adaption made period!\r\n\r\nThe Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and \r\ncontinued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain \r\nAmerica. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just \r\nfinished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L. \r\nJackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about \r\njoining Avengers Initiative\u0085in that short scene, the framework for \r\npotentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun! \r\n\r\nDirector Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire \r\nSlayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and \r\nbrings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The \r\nAvengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain \r\nAmerica/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce \r\nBanner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye \r\n(Jeremy Renner) as \"assembled\" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually \r\ninclude clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery \r\nand The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic \r\nbooks, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.\r\n\r\nThe cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life, \r\nbeginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey \r\nseemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost \r\neffortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his \r\ncharisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS \r\nTony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain \r\nAmerica. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role \r\nstanding alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god \r\nThor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of \r\nthe film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in \r\nIron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story, \r\nwhich helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to \r\nprove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous \r\npsychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying \r\na beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was \r\nmost concerned about being given little story and the least amount of \r\nscreen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the \r\nwayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character. \r\nHawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger \r\nGames) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see \r\nmore of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice \r\nto play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The \r\nHulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the \r\npart of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking \r\nangry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most \r\nimpressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he \r\ndisplays when the opportunity calls for him to \"hulk out\". If any \r\ncharacter appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for \r\nme it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than \r\njust the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to \r\nstretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role. \r\nClark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her \r\nMarvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition. \r\nThe film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom \r\nHiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play \r\nbeing opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but \r\nHiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go \r\nunnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is \r\nnot a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious \r\nmastermind without being cartoonish.\r\n\r\nAt a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time \r\nflies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the \r\nscript drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may \r\nnot have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're \r\nprovided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without \r\nfeeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book \r\nfilm, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action \r\nand humor. \r\n\r\nAlthough the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are \r\nshort changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work \r\nwith, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale \r\nprovides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual \r\nwith Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence, \r\nwhich provides a surprising reveal.\r\n\r\nI went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of \r\nthose that were involved, as well as the films that came before it. \r\nAfter viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set \r\nmyself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the \r\nfilm started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my \r\nexpectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to \r\nput onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the \r\nsense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with \r\nthese characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and \r\nDisney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and \r\ndeservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its \r\ncaliber.\r\n\r\nGrade: A+\r\n\r\n\n"

I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's\ncharacter uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film...\nStark now knows he's not the only superhero in his world and it's as\nbig a treat for our real world as it gets. Seeing the \"Avenger\nInitiative\" in action is as great as I would ever have hoped! Hell, who\nam I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who\nwould've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a\nfilm and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene\none and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced.\nTruthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every\nstudio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really\nthink most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this\nmovie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion\nand payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the\nworld later. Right now, I'm simply basking in the greatness I just\nwitnessed!\n"

This movie works on so many levels\nand makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember\nwhen I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it\nextra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts\nfrom each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they\nall delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in\nAvengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat.\nExample: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse\nthunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said\nfor every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit,\nit's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what\nmakes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any\nother franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and\neven Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers\nall angles and delivers depth with its fun."

The Avengers is without a doubt my\nfavorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon\ndid a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously\nput together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The\nactors did such a great job playing these characters again and it\ndidn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to\nbe in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the\ncharacters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with\nhappiness.

                "reviews": "\nThe Avengers \u0096 CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie\nis undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand\nthe Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous\nIronman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the\navenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so\ngetting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be\nfoolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony\nStark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain\nAmerica), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent\nMaria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's\njourney starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The\nAvenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production\nand performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best\nout of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant\nthan all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to\ngenerous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out\nof each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something\nwe don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each\nother. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his\ncharming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him\nthe superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of\nthunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you\njump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is\nindeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of\na true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie\nbelong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see\nsome humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster\nthis time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett\nJohansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie\nbut this time around we completely understand the strength and\nwickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic.\nJeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with\nBlack Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further\nattention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the\nS.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was\nthe ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor,\nhe has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts)\nappearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman\n(Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest\nbrilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great\nperformance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly\nrecommended in 3D.\n"

                "reviews": "\nAs you well know by now, \"The Avengers\" is a large-scale superhero film\nthat was four years in the making, with no less than four individual -\nyet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall\nstory. Joss \"Firefly\" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this\nhighly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics\nsuperhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small\ncameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a\nhand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America\n(Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce\nBanner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth),\nNatasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint\nBarton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury,\nAgent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous\nAsgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying\nwaste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually\naccustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come\ntogether as a team to save the world. What gets \"The Avengers\" many\npoints is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special\neffects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually\nrelegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I\nliked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual\ncharacters so that we get to know them all over again - even though\nthey've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big\nsuperhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor\nthat manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this\nthing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!"

I had the opportunity to see this movie in 3D, and although\nthe technology didn't seem to be used brilliantly, it made the damaged\ncity of San Francisco all the more epic. Although it's impossible for\nthe San Andreas fault line to produce an earthquake more than 8.3, at\nleast it makes for a wonderfully heart-pumping movie. One earthquake\nstrikes after another, and then a tsunami, and by the end, San\nFrancisco is so demolished it looks impossible to rebuild it, but, of\ncourse, some people were still somehow able to survive. The movie was\nso unbelievably intense I thought I was going to have heart\npalpitations at some points. Although I have never been a big fan of\nDwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, or Alexandra Daddario, they all perform\nwell here; director Brad Peyton and Dwayne Johnson have created a much\nbetter movie than the Journey movies."

I did not however, expect a love\nstory in the mix of events. Now, I must say, if you're expecting a\nchick flick, this isn't the movie you're looking for. Ray (Dwayne\nJohnson) known for his roles in Fast and Furious 6 and 7 as well as\nG.I. Joe, plays the role as a fire and rescue-chopper pilot divorced by\nhis ex wife Emma (Carla Gugino). The divorced couple travels across the\nstate of California in search of their daughter Blake (Alexandra\nDaddario) after Emma's boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd)\nabandons her. Meanwhile, Blake tries to find her parents alongside two\nBritish acquaintances Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his brother Ollie\n(Art Parkinson) that she met that day. At several parts of the film,\nthe action and realistic perspective leaves you breathless. The film\nmakers did an amazing job at bringing you into the action of the real\nevent of the earthquake that occurred. The film itself is best enjoyed\nby those with an interest in intense dramatic action and those with a\nlove of movies based off of real events. Steven Rea; The Inquirer\nstates \"San Andreas is awesome fun. Director Brad Peyton and his army\nof visual effects and digital artists have created a temblor tableau of\nwreckage in motion.\" Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Labreque claims that\n\"It seems familiar , lacks depth or perspective, and isn't based in\nscience.\" While this is in some ways true, Labreque misses the point.\nIf every movie was 100% accurate, the intended audience population as a\nwhole, would be a lot less.\n"

It will never win Oscars (not\nincluding special effects) and its not some critical masterpiece but it\nis purely entertainment. It is the sort of popcorn, theatre flick that\nwe rarely see anymore. Its the type of movie that reminds you why we\nall fell in love with movies. I smiled, I cringed, I cried out loud, I\nteared up...it was remarkable. I could watch this again and again\nwithout hesitation.

After watching San Andres Fault by mistake I was\nso hopeful that nothing could be quite as bad as that. I was wrong. I\nknow it's a big blockbuster and made to leave the viewer in awe, but I\njust laughed at it. My partner and I sat and said what was going to\nhappen next and it did. The plot was dire from the start and I was kind\nof hoping the film would end before it had even got half way through\nit. Why do they always have Brits in American films who sound like they\nare so posh? Totally not called for. The acting was OK and I like\nDwayne Johnson, but this was beneath him. The most ridiculous film in\nyears.\n"

The story line\nand plot wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't anything you haven't\nseen before, very clich\u00e9d and predictable. The Rock's performance in\nthis film did give it that extra kick that was needed to make this film\na bit more tolerable.

And the close up scenes just don't work as the\ncamera is too focused on the actors faces and Dwayne Johnson's biceps\nrather than the action we paid to see in the first place. Like most\nfilms that rely too much on CGI, the destruction just isn't believable,\nand happens too fast in several scenes for you to understand what\nyou're looking at. However I have to admit that finally seeing San\nFrancisco take it up the Richter Scale scored high with me.\n"

From the\nvery first little movie to the latest I have enjoyed each in different\nways for different reasons. None is a failure. From what I had heard\nand read this newest (and I hope not the last!) instalment was\ninferior, not respectful of its predecessors, poorly thought out and,\nas one reviewer wrote, makes a hash of all that went before.\nFortunately for me I had seen the old double VCR version of T2 with an\nalternate ending, i.e., the destruction of San Francisco. Imagine my\njoy to see it in this movie. Terminator Genisys is reverential - there\nare so many scenes from the first movie it is almost plagiarism. The\ntricky business of time is dealt with most satisfactorily. The most\nshocking reversal of earlier matters was jarring but OK. Emilia Clarke\nwas superb as this Sarah Conner. How fortunate we have been with all\nthree actors Linda Hamilton, Lena Heady (on television) and Clarke! The\nmale leads were very good, particularly the John Conner character with\nJ.K Simmons giving another wonderful performance. I found the whole\nmovie very satisfying and I hope that we will yet again hear the words,\n\"I'll be bahck.\"\n"

Being the fifth instalment, things\ncould have gone way bad by now with really bad production values,\nridiculous scripts and inappropriately cheesy lines. Instead Genisys\nstays true to the essence of the franchise, considers its cheesy\nmoments very carefully (I still here Pops saying \"I might be older, but\nI am not obsolete\") and gave us a really good tie up of events \u0096 even\nif the base idea was stolen from the Star Trek reboot. Let's compare it\nto many other franchises like Batman and Superman and Alien, which by\nmovie 4 really went off the rails \u0096 not even Uma Thurman could save\nthat script... A lot of reviews complain about Salvation (which I also\ndid not enjoy either) and Genysis (which I though was a good recover).\nThe film is filled with Easter Eggs of moments referencing other\npopular Arnold Schwarzenegger movies as well as the original three\nfilms. And to be honest\u0085this is Terminator we are talking about \u0096 we\nare not expecting the Bond flick. So the fact that the film is flawed\nfrom a critical point and often does not cover its own continuity aside\n\u0096 it does stick to the reality it created and the time-space\ndiscrepancies are easily forgiven. All in all it is well worth the\nmoney I spent on the movie and the popcorn, for the awesome use of\neffects, revisiting old favourite moments from the series and a story\nthat actually is not that bad \u0096 come one, I can hear someone saying\nthat it was a weak storyline\u0085.but I repeat\u0085this is Terminator we are\ntalking about\u0085\n"

Congrats, you must be\nover 30 years old. \"Terminator 3\" (2003) has already been a major\ndisappointment and the sequel \"Salvation\" (2009), while at least trying\nsomething new, was incredibly lifeless. \"Genisys\" picks up the\nnostalgic approach of \"T3\" again and turns soon into a parade of\nreferences to the seminal first two movies. But while in those the\nelement of time travel was just a storytelling twist that set up the\nmain plot, the latest sequel makes the mistake to turn it into the\nmajor propellant of the happenings on screen, so expect a lot of blah\nblah about alternate time lines, \"Nexus points\" (there is an exposition\nabout this nonsense, yawn) and whatnot, but it's just a ploy to cobble\ntogether variation of scenes we already know from the preceding films.\nWorst of all is the fact though that the film seems to feel very smart\nabout this approach, yet there is no inherent logic to all the time\ntravel stuff and the writers even had the balls to state that a lot of\nit will be explained in the sequel- which I hope never realizes. The\nacting is mostly rather bad. I have never seen \"Game of Thrones\", but\nEmilia Clarke did not impress me here with her shrill interpretation of\nSarah Connor. Jai Courtney is wooden as always and B-movie face Jason\nClarke must be the least intimidating Terminator on screen so far.\nArnold seems a little lost and his role is reduced to that of Mr.\nExposition and Dad Surrogate. The action is not very impressive either,\nit misses the inventiveness and precision of Cameron's direction. Some\nof the physics are just ludicrous, even for an action movie. Bad CGI\nreinforces the feeling that nothing is at stake, a feeling that is\nalready established by the fact that the time travel shenanigans opened\nthe door for all kinds of randomness.\n"

The final\nbattle consists of scenes where a battalion of seasoned SS soldiers run\nback and forth through our heroes' machine gun fire, only stopping when\nit is time for a forced emotional exchange inside the tank. While the\ndirector chose to have every other enemy brandish an anti-tank weapon\nin the ominous lead-in to the final battle, for some reason only three\nof them are fired, two which miss at unrealistically close range. The\nridiculousness of it all turned me into that obnoxious movie goer that\nlaughs out loud during what should be a serious and emotional scene. "

                "reviews": "\nThis film gave me a feeling of initial distaste, which rapidly grew to\nanger, and yes FURY, as the story line progressed. Compared to the\nmasterful 'Saving Private Ryan' this film was a prime example of how to\nmake a piece of garbage and, with a major star in the leading role and\ngood marketing, turn it into a box office winner. Where do I start?\nWell, the tank crew is a bunch of thugs who look as if they just came\nout of jail - yeah we saw it all before in the 'Dirty Dozen', the\n'Bridge at Remagen' and so on. But these guys had no redeeming features\nat all - just a bunch of psychopaths with guns. Even the Brad Pitt\nleading character took pleasure in killing enemy prisoners and\nencouraging the innocent young recruit to do likewise. Yes, these ugly\nincidents did happen in the war, and US soldiers were often guilty of\nsuch 'heat of the moment' atrocities, but they were exceptions, NOT the\nrule! And to make this behaviour seem normal is highly irresponsible,\nnot to say defamatory to the US Army. Then there is the perpetuation of\nthe old myth about the Waffen SS being cruel maniacs etc when in\nreality they were highly disciplined and effective soldiers who often\nbehaved more correctly than the Wehrmacht. The apex of stupidity came\nin the long climactic final scene in which the Pitt character and his\nthree colleagues kill hundreds of SS troopers with a single broken down\nSherman tank before finally being overwhelmed and killed - the naive\nyoung recruit being the only survivor. I could not believe what I was\nseeing. This is war for the video gaming generation, not for anyone who\nhas actually gone through this hellish experience. The Germans ran\naround like headless chickens and let themselves be mowed down by\nmachine gun fire like turkeys. This is so unbelievably moronic that it\nmakes one cringe with embarrassment. I felt I should have asked for a\nrefund after watching such crap. Awful.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI recently saw the new movie \"Fury\" with Brad Pitt, and keep reading\nhow \"realistic\" it is supposed to be. Here is my take on this movie\n(SPOILERS): Brad Pitt plays a psychotic tank platoon sergeant who kills\nan unarmed, clearly surrendering POW to teach a new tank crew member\n\"how to kill\". No officers or senior NCOs make any effort to stop him.\nHis company commander next gives him an important mission for his tank\nplatoon. On this mission, thru poor crew discipline, poor road march\ndiscipline, and very bad tank tactics ends up getting his entire\nplatoon wiped out. If you look closely, this movie is just a very\ncynical version of \"Saving Private Ryan\" with some \"Cross of Iron\"\nthrown in. It reminds me of those \"Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos\"\ncomic books of the 60's, and the end is very similar to the \"Ghost\nTank\" story lines in that comic book. In fact, I suspect strongly that\nthis scrip started out as a film script version of that comic book. The\nvast majority of the real members of the 2nd Armored Division were not\npsychopaths, and by April 1945 they had very good discipline and\nknowledge of tank tactics. Despite the hype, this is another case of\nHollywood WW II, not the real one. Brad Pitt's character needs to be\ngiven a Section 8.\n"

It begins\nwith a ridiculous scene, is of the war movie genre that demands German\nsoldiers running upright and without cover toward machine guns so our\nanti-heroes can mow them down conveniently, and consistently opts for\nopportunities to shove the new hip narrative that lovingly depicts\nAmerican soldiers as murderous, war crime committing, raping thugs.\nSee: 'Inglorious Basterds.' Much of it is hard to watch, especially\nafter 'Saving Private Ryan' which set a high bar for any war movie\nfollowing, the rest is drivel. And, not even good drivel at that. High\nmarks (pardon the pun) though, for the German soldiers surrounding the\ntank, who stop firing for inexplicable reasons, but which coincide with\nlong discussions on war and friendship by the tank crew.\n"

Last scene: Brad\nPitt's tank is set to hold an important crossroads. Loses tread on\nmine. Lookout spots 250 SS infantry troops on the way, with an armored\ncar or two. Brad Pitt says were gonna duke it out. (um, I haven't been\nin the army, but I would at that point hide in the woods and call an\nair strike. Long columns of troops hate being strafed by fighter\nplanes.) SS gets up to the tank and then the tank opens fire. Kills a\nbunch of SS. Germans send wave after wave of infantry guys with machine\nguns against tank. (somehow, even though it is April 1945 and the\nGermans have been fighting for 7 years or so, they don't realize a\nmachine gun can't hurt a tank.) They have a guy with a bazooka but he\npositioned himself at the front of the tank and the tank shot him\nfirst. Not sure why he didn't walk around to the rear to the immobile\ntank and blow it up. After a hundred or so Germans have been killed by\ndoing wind sprints in the limited field of fire, Brad Pitt says the\nhell with it with it stands on the top of tank and shots more Germans.\nHe is silhouetted against a burning building and a wily German sniper\nsneaks up. He hits Brad Pitt 3 times, but Brad Pitt crawls back into\ntank. (Hmmm\u0085usually one shot is all a sniper needs. This sniper goes\nfor the rarely used \"shoulder shot\"). At this point there is only Brad\nPitt and one other guy left. The other guy says \"Sarg, Im scared.\" Brad\nPitt also discloses that he too is scared. German opens the top hatch\nand drops two of those weird looking hand grenades a foot away from\nBrad Pitt. Must of maxed out the timers, because Brad Pitt has time to\ntell the other guy its OK to run and there is a bottom hatch he can\nuse. The guy opens it and drops to the ground. Two explosions rock the\ntank. The guy crawls in a hole beneath tank. Bunch of SS troops are\nmilling about the tank. One peeks under the tank with a flashlight, he\nsees the American, but pretends he didn't. Lots of the SS guys were\npretty OK dudes I guess. American goes to sleep. Wakes up next morning\nthe Germans are gone. He goes into tank, instead of the turret of the\ntank having Brad Pitt wallpaper, his body is resting peacefully. He\nlooks good. He is Brad Pitt after all. Looks like he passed away from\nembarrassment from being in such a horrible movie. Last guy covers him\nup. He gets rescued, medic says to him, \"you're a hero.\" I think that\nwas suppose to be meaningful, ironic or something. Its called \"Fury\"\nbecause thats the way I felt after spending $10.50 on it.\n"

The\nstory has more holes than a Swiss cheese. A clich\u00e9 love trope between\nthe Bambi and a blonde trophy chick. The crew behaves in ways that\nwould have gotten them court-martialed ten times over. A lone Tiger in\nthe middle of nowhere with gasoline in the tank. Sure. A battalion SS\nmarching with an abundance of Panzerfausts slung over their shoulders,\nand yet they get horribly butchered by a tracked tank in the middle of\na road that has roadside ditches left and right and they all of a\nsudden have to bring in their \"last\" Panzerfausts in crates and still\ndon't get the job done. Film, story and acting are bad. Do not watch\nthis film without some friends and lots of beverage around.

The Times got it wrong and the film makers got it very, very\nwrong. Why is it so hard to make an accurate movie about World War II?\nMany of the participants are still alive and they are always very\noffended with filmmakers present nonsense, like this movie. First of\nall the film makers chose to have this story take place in April of\n1945, then they ignore the situation as it stood at that time. The war\nin Europe ended on May 7, 1945. The fact is that the five man crew of\nthis tank had to know that the war was almost over as they were\nfighting deep in Germany. At that time the Allies (US, Britain, USSR\net.al.) had more than twice as many soldiers and way more equipment\nthan the Germans. Most of the German army was trying to get to the West\nto surrender to the Americans because they knew that they would be\ntreated better than being captured by the Russians. In April alone 2.3\nmillion German soldiers surrendered. To watch this movie one would\nbelieve that the Germans outnumbered the Allies and outrageous acts of\nvalor were required. In fact, the allies were aware of the mass\nsurrenders and trying to minimize their casualties. It is true that the\nUS Department of war gave the armies inferior tanks. They chose to\nmanufacture Sherman tanks which had far less armor and artillery. It\nwas chosen because it was cheap and could be manufactured in greater\nnumbers and the allies had far more of these tanks. But the German\ntanks were better, that much is true. As a result the Allies attacked\nin mass formations. Not one loan tank. This brings us to the final\nclimatic scene. The five man tank crew are all alone in a broken down\ntank. There is battalion of about 250 Germans coming they're way. Pitt\ndecides to stay there and battle the 250 Germans alone. In a broken\ndown tank. In the last month of the war. His heroic (stupidity)\nattracts all four of his comrades who agree to a pointless fight to the\ndeath. The terrible part is that the Germans mindlessly walk into the\nTank's line of fire as if they were Zombies. Maybe they were left over\nextras from Pitt's last movie World War Z. Maybe Hitler was so\ndesperate for soldiers he enlisted the very old, the very young and\neven the recently undead. Anyway, even though the Germans co-operated\nin being slaughtered by the Americans they eventually overwhelm them.\nBut there is more: in the closing scene we see scores of dead Germans\nsurrounding the disabled tank. Notice that none of the dead Germans\nfell on the rough road. They all managed to die on the soft grass. I\nthought for a moment that the newly arrived troops moved the bodies off\nof the road, but they would have laid them in rows. This was not the\ncase. The Germans were lying about as they had fallen. Just not on that\nrough, dirty road!\n"

The movie begins by saying that the German tanks\nwere superior to the American ones, and thus US tank units suffered\nhigh losses. You would expect some tank battles in the movie, right?\nWrong! It is April 1945, not so many German tanks to resist the\nAmerican advance. Actually, only one German tank features in the movie.\nTruth be told, the battle with the German tank (Tiger or PIV) was\nsomewhat realistic, assuming that the German tank crew was not\nexperienced. A lot of strange things in the final fighting scene:\nFirst, the Germans are in a war zone, but they are marching in a\ncolumn, singing, like they are on Unter den Linden in 1939. Then, the\ntank crew had plenty of time to prepare the ambush, chat and drink in\nthe tank. But they left part of the ammo outside. The fight starts in\ndaytime and in a matter of minutes it's dark. The German soldiers keep\nrunning to the bullets, frontally charging against the machine guns.\nYeah, Schwarzenegger would have been a better choice than Brad Pitt in\nthis scene.

The final battle scene which\nshould have been the most exciting and terrifying part of the film was\nthe most disappointing, Germans just running about in front of an\nimmobilised tank getting mowed down by its machine guns. Brad Pitts\ncharacter spends an amazing amount of time on the outside of the tank\nwhich is surrounded by hundreds of Germans before a German sniper\neventually gets him, two grenades are dropped into the tank and yet\nwhen the remaining crew member crawls back into the tank the rest of\nthe dead crew look remarkably intact. Even the Tiger tank scene failed\nto raise the excitement levels as it was all too predictable as to what\nthe final outcome of the scene was going to be, another fail was\nwhenever someone was injured or died there was a silence as if the\nGermans decided to stop fighting to let the Americans come to terms\nwith their latest causality. Fury made me recall the battle scenes in\nSaving Private Ryan because they were done so much better in that film,\nthe scene with the Tiger tank gave me flashbacks to Kelly's Heroes\nagain another film that done it so much better. Part of the problem is\nour expectations are raised at the beginning of the film as the opening\ncredits state that the Allies encountered ferocious resistance in the\nend days of the war, what we end up seeing is the Germans being\nmilitary naive and suicidal. The core story is good, the film is gritty\nand brutal but in the end what should have been the films strongest\ncard the battle scenes, let it down.\n"

This film\ncertainly doesn't paint American soldiers in a good light, although\nafter slogging their way across Europe for months on end, facing\nsense-numbing death and destruction on a daily basis, perhaps it is a\nrealistic portrayal? I just don't know, and would be interested to hear\nthe views of any veterans who were there."

                "reviews": "\nFury pits a tank filled with five American soldiers at the tail end of\nWorld War II as they struggle to fight off a small army of Nazi\nsoldiers that are closing in on them. David Ayer directs this brutal\nand grim war film with no romance to it. Ayer's film is grim, bloody\nand unrelenting and fully captures the absolutely horrific nature of\nwar. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is far from Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglorious\nBasterds, he is a man who is truly run ragged by this war. So much so\nthat it is all the character knows. Followed by his brigade of\nmiserable men played by the likes of Michael Pe\u00f1a, Shia LaBeouf, Logan\nLerman and Jon Bernthal, Fury depicts not only the atrocities of war\nbut the ideology of brotherhood with this film. Each of these actors,\nespecially LaBeouf, give their all in roles that are merely supporting\non paper. Ayer has an extremely keen eye for chemistry on screen and he\ndirects each of these actors to deliver performances that are well\nbeyond anything that could be scripted. These men truly feel as if they\nare brothers in arms and you buy into every second of it. The film on a\ntechnical level is terrific. Ayer ditches his hand held method for\nstill shots and dolly rigs and it pays off ten fold. The film is\nvisually stunning, a pure grit to the desaturated frame is present from\nstart to finish. As I touched on before, Fury is a violent war film\nmuch so in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Lone Survivor. You are\nsubjected to every bullet wound, every explosion of sharp shrapnel,\nevery wound with the utmost visceral imagery. It is disturbing yet\nnecessary for a film like this. Deapite these dark tones and brutality,\nFury does feature lighter moments especially with Logan Lerman who\ngives a seemingly bare-bones performance as Norman Ellison that is\nsubtle but extremely effective as he slowly becomes desensitized to all\nthe violence around him. His performance is constantly evolving along\nwith his character, letting us see layer after layer until he comes\nfull circle in a bloody final act. The best way to describe Fury is by\ncomparing it to Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot just with a tank instead\nof a submarine. Its claustrophobic, up close and personal, making the\nscenes of harrowing violence even more effective. Overall, Fury is a\nbrutal war film that shows war exactly how it should be shown. Its\ndisturbing, its violent, its scary. Fury really hits a home run between\nthe sweeping cinematography, the phenomenal performances and the near\nperfect direction, it is one hell of a film that shouldn't be missed.\n"

That's pretty much all he\ndoes again in \"Fury.\" This isn't your \"Saving Private Ryan\" like war\nfilm, but more of a fun action film with spectacular sound and editing\nthat triggers exceptional war scenes and a lot of dead Nazis. Brad Pitt\ngives an overdone performance as Wardaddy, a southern commander who\nleads his tank and four men into enemy lines throughout Nazi-occupied\nEuoper. The entire film features awesome war scenes with multiple\nexplosions and machine gun fires, but never does anything else. \"Fury\"\nis handled well by director David Ayer because he stays clear on what\nhis purpose is. He doesn't overdo his film, but instead creates a\nterrific and unrealistic action film set in WW II. Nothing more,\nnothing less.\n"

How the film\nand its director David Ayer feel about the premise is ideologically\nconfused and contradictory. On one hand the film is a brutal\nrepresentation of the final tank battles of the war and how merciless\nthe Allies were to Germans and their prisoners as a way of saving their\nown hides. Yet the film's fascist politics are exemplified by showing\nhow young men become accepted into the brainless, macho brotherhood of\ntheir peers once they are capable of murdering enemies without\nhesitation. Some will dismiss the film as a silly boy's club adventure,\nbut this does little to dispel the unsavouriness. Fury's timing is as\nmisjudged as it is deliberate. In an era of contemporary global\nwarfare, it's a film disturbingly unconcerned by psychology or battle\nscars but celebrating how many kills a single tank crew can score for\ntheir country. "

A lot of thought provoking\nmaterial, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't\nusually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. \nEnjoy!\n"

Keanu Reeves is picked up by agents\nwho force a mechanical object in through his navel and he awakens in\nhis own bed. Laurence Fishburne informs him that the Matrix is\neverything around him. It is destined to keep people under control.\nReeves is presented with two pills. One will allow him to awaken\nwithout memory of the incident, and the other one allows him to\ndiscover whether or not he is the Missing Link. Directed by Larry and\nAndy Wachowski showcasing distracting action scenes and interesting\ntheories. This is certainly a departure from their earlier film, Bound.\nReeves is appealing as someone thrusts out of ordinariness into the\noverwhelming unknown. Fishburne makes for a fine instructor as he\nallows Reeves the freedom of choice but cautions him on the\nconsequences. In other roles are the electrifying Carrie-Anne Moss, and\nthe double-crossing Joe Pantoliano as the villain. Hugo Weaving also\nplays a villain named Agent Smith who has an array of special powers\nthat screws up more than one's brain. The action is exhilarating with\nthe most original combat scenes ever filmed. Overwhelming visual appeal\naccompany the symbolism. Score: 8 / 10\n"

Along with great acting performances from Keanu Reeves\nand the always great Laurence Fishburne, they have managed to create a\nfilm that contains eye catching special effects, way ahead of its time\nand a storyline that teaches you the value of human life against its\nmass destruction. Hugo Weaving whom plays Agent Smith is the ultimate\nbad guy. His originality as a villain sparks up even more excitement\nwhen conflict starts between him and Neo (Keanu Reeves). It does not\ntake long for the action to start, which couldn't be better for a\ntypical action lover. The film has everything, action, thrills, martial\narts, superhuman abilities and love.\n"

I've heard a lot of people say it hasn't aged well, and I\nhave to strongly disagree and say that this movie was ahead of it's\ntime, making now (2014) a perfect time to watch it! While it's sequels\nstruggle to conduct a clear plot and fumbles around with countless\nloopholes in logic, the original film doesn't have a single story\nmistake (at least as far as I can think of!) and manages to follow\nthrough with intelligence and cleverness. Style! Did I mention this\nmovie has style? In more ways than one. Not to mention a dozen pop\nculture references, a solid cast, and unforgettable special effects.\nThe whole movie is laced with dialogue that becomes a brain game for\nthe audience, forcing them to think and ponder about whether or not\ntheir own world is real or not. I know when I first watched it, I\nstarted to get a bit paranoid! The overall atmosphere of the film is\none of awakening to your surroundings, the struggle between what people\ntell you to feel, and what you truly feel. Rebellion, the challenging\nof authority, being creative and the survival of human life. Overall,\nthe film is basically one big action packed, mentally stimulating and\ngratifying present wrapped with a bow that is trying to say in the\nbiggest way possible: You can do anything if you believe..."

It very intricately brings out the Complex Equilibrium\nthat we ought to maintain, otherwise in presence of some 'Super\nIntelligence' we might find it very difficult to control the\nrepercussions, even if it's not like the Matrix story line itself. It\nsignifies the spirit of Human Survival against all the odds; and also,\nan urge to manifest one's desires as human, even in adverse\ncircumstances. Great acting by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne,\nCarrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and others.

The jumping is great. The shooting is great. The writing\nis \u0085. good maybe. Okay so the idea of The Matrix is good. It's probably\nbeen done before. The whole idea is that the Matrix is a reality\ncreated in a computer for humans to live in. I found this intriguing\nand enjoyed this premise. But the writing. It's alright. This movie is\ndriven by action. The writing is in the backseat and the action is\ndriving the car. The movie is full of philosophical talking and one\nliners. And it's not great. It works, but it's not great. The acting is\nactually really good for a film like this. Keanu Reeves does a really\ngood job. Laurence Fishburne is awesome as Morpheus. Though there is\nHugo Weaving. He is an incredible villain that is benefited by the\nstrong part of the movie the action. He is meticulous and menacing\nwhenever he is on screen. The other cast is good, but not great.\nHowever we should really talk about the better thing about this movie.\nThe action. Holy cow. Mind-blowing. Okay the tech is a little bit\nprimitive by now, but it really is effective. I mean the bullet time.\nThe slow motion work. It's amazing. It's so fun to watch. I will say\nthat that the settings of the film are also very creative. The way the\nMatrix works, the scout ship. I love it. I will say that the costume\ndesign is a little bit dated. The black trench coats are fun, but they\nare a little but dated. I will say that my liking for this film is\ndampened by the fact that I LOVE the Wachowski's better crafted and\namazing Cloud Atlas. Just because that movie is incredible and the fact\nthat this was also the Wachowski's other film I just had trouble with\ntaking this move as seriously. But its good. I give The Matrix an 8 out\nof 10\n"

Keanu Reeves may be dryer than a stick under the scorching\nCalifornia sun, but I still think he was one of the greatest of all\npossible casting choices for Neo. The true scene-stealer of the film,\nhowever, is the mesmerizing brilliant Hugo Weaving, as the chilling and\ncalculative Agent Smith. He isn't the typical villain, but an extremely\nintelligent baddie, whose every utterance is a fascinating piece of his\nmulti-faceted, yet cold-hearted mind. Of course, the real crowd-drawer\nhere though, is the visually spectacular special effects.\n"

It was a pleasant\nsurprise having entered to the cinema expecting another inept variation\nof Taken, and finding a more realistic and personal tale, based on\nhuman emotions instead of shootouts and explosions. Let me clear out\nsomething: there are abundant shootouts and explosions in No Escape,\nbut they aren't employed as visual ornament or pyrotechnical fetish,\nbut as a dramatic auxiliary which complements the desperate situation\nof the Dwyer family. Owen Wilson and Lake Bell bring very good\nperformances in the leading roles, equally dominating the family drama\nand the tense chases in which their characters have to make things they\nconsidered themselves incapable of. I think this is Wilson's first\naction role since Behind Enemy Lines (back in 2001), and it suits him\npretty well, because it doesn't rely on his physical development too\nmuch, but on the internal strength his character must build, well\nhandled by his performance. The same applies to Bell, whose usual\nhumorous roles tend to hide her capacity to transmit quite an intensity\n(even though she had already displayed her wide histrionic range in\nBlack Rock). Pierce Brosnan also brings a decent performance, but his\ncharacter feels a bit clich\u00e9d. Director John Erick Dowdle forged\nhimself in the horror genre (Quarantine, Devil and As Above, So Below),\nand it seems that having handled zombies, demons and ghosts was a good\npreparation for the more mundane (and also more frightening) horrors of\na civil war and a family in danger. His direction feels very natural,\nbut without forgetting some visual tricks which bring style to the\nmovie. Despite not being something great, I found No Escape a competent\nand very entertaining action thriller with more substance than usual,\nwith the additional benefit of eliminating any wish to visit the Asian\nsoutheast. I understand why the country the Dwyer family moved to is\nnever mentioned... doing that, there's no risk of demands or\ninternational incidents.\n"

It was directed by John Erick\nDowdle, who previously directed the underrated \"Quarantine\" (2008),\n2010's \"Devil\" and 2014's \"As Above, So Below\". In addition to helming\nthis one, he also co-wrote the script with his brother, Drew Dowdle, as\nhe did with \"Quarantine\" and \"As Above\". Yet, \"No Escape\" is not a\nhorror flick.

Owen Wilson was great in this film and so was Peirce\nBronson. The story is Simple;An American Family goes away on Holiday\nand when they get there a crazy war starts.a gang of people from that\ncountry start killing tourists.they kill people one by one in the Hotel\nand Owen Wilson and his family try to escape in the chaos. i liked the\nfour main characters of the film,they were likable and i felt sorry for\nthem when they were being chased. i thought the acting was very good\nfrom everyone and i also thought the writing was good. the film was\nalso very well directed. the bad guys were Brutal Maniacs,they were\nreally nasty pieces of work and i would Not want to run into these\npeople. the bad guys used guns and grenades and cannons among other\nweapons to hunt people with and they blew everything to pieces.This\nFilm is Definitely Brutal and bloody.the film is action packed and i\nwas hooked all the way through.it was fast paced and adrenaline pumping\nand i never got bored once. this film had me on the edge of my seat the\nwhole time and the film was very intense!. the film has a lot of chase\nscenes in it and it was a very entertaining film.

The people in the movie were supposed to be Thai but everything\nelse was not really Thai (e.g., the protesters, the junta government,\nall the signs, the brothel). Furthermore, Thailand shares no border\nwith Vietnam. I would say that this movie gives such a false (and\nalmost unfair) portrayal of the country.

Once the film's\nturning point reaches, the build up of the tensions with slow motion\nvisual had a nice touch to it but nothing new to what we haven't\nalready seen. Simple things in a \"Run for life\" situations where\ndepicted in a very realistic way.

Sir, had you shown this ending ( I suggested ) your\nfilm would have collected about 15-20 million more. the audience did\nget relieved but they did NOT get full satisfaction they were looking\nfor. That's why directors must consult people like me who for a\nnegligible amount can advise an ending which can get you millions\nextra. remember all that the audience takes home is the ENDING which is\nthe MOST crucial part of a movie.

The premise of this film\nsees an American family move to southern asia, where they get hunted by\na group of rebels looking for revenge. Now Owen Wilson is a pretty good\ncomedic actor but this is probably the best dramatic role he has ever\ndone. His character was forced to become a hero even though he was a\nnormal guy and he was very relatable for the audience. He brought some\nhumour to the role and great dramatic moments. They give Owen Wilson a\nwife and two daughters and all of them are great in this film. They\nreally added allot to the film and are used for huge dramatic moments\nthat really bring the intensity. Pierce brosnan is really good in this\nmovie even though he plays his usual role, I just wish there had been a\nlittle more of him. The story was pretty simple and that does mean\nsometimes there isn't enough meat in this film character wise. However,\nthis film never stops moving And it really does the family aspect of\nthe film well. The script has some okay humour and decent dramatic\ndialogue but sometimes you don't feel the weight of the situation like\nyou should. The style was okay with the intensity of some scenes that\nreally worked. However, there was an overuse of shaky cam and slow\nmotion that take away from the action scenes. Overall this is a good\nsolid thriller that is worth a watch.\n"

This time the offending\ncountry is Thailand. (Yes, Thailand.) Why are the Thais, the land of\nlovely ladies, in such a tizzy? Well, without becoming a spoiler, let's\njust say that it is for a reason that is far-fetched and leave it at\nthat. Yes, it's only a movie, and yes, there is something known as\nliterary license, but still, they could have come up with a more\nplausible explanation. But, so what? It's still a good movie. Owen\nWilson does a great job, showing his talent as a dramatic actor. True,\nan entire nation, which has been a staunch ally of the United States\nsince the end of World War Two, is maligned and depicted as an enemy of\nthe United States but such an unlikely scenario provides the background\nto heighten the story's intensity. Yet, rarely has an entire people\nbeen more thoroughly disparaged in a movie than the Thais. After\nwatching this movie, one can reasonably wonder if the Thai people are a\nbunch of marauders who understand only one thing: violence. The nature\nof violence and mayhem perpetrated by the Thais in this movie is\nextreme. Throughout the entire movie mobs of Thai men are shown running\namok. They are rampaging all over the place, burning, pillaging,\nraping, shooting, that is, committing all kind of heinous acts, even\nusing tanks and helicopters as instruments of terror, driven by some\nvague grudge against a handful of hapless Americans who have no idea\nwhat is going on, which in that context makes the behavior of the Thais\nseem even more bizarre. Why a Hollywood movie would want to target\nThailand for such an unsavory depiction is a matter for speculation.\nHowever, one thing is for certain: if you are an American thinking\nabout traveling to Thailand, after watching this movie, you may want to\nthink about changing your plans. If that seems far-fetched, watch the\nmovie.\n"

There are good people in this country, victims and there are\nthe people involved in the uprising.

Since the release of \"Star Wars Episode I:\nThe\nPhantom Menace\", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and\nIII\nwill eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films,\nmaking them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older\nand\nnew films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow\nfresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook\nallows\nus to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the\noriginal trilogy: \"Return of the Jedi\".  Often derided for its overly\n'cute'\nfactor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly\nless\nimpressive than the nearly perfect \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  Indeed the\n'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the\nentire\nseries.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for\nthe\nmerchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question."

                "reviews": "\n\nAfter \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" redefined science fiction, and \"The Empire\nStrikes Back\" redefined \"Star Wars\", it's hard to believe that the third and\nfinal film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but\nthis one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the\ncliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is\nin keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films.\nThen the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the\nwar.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's\nfinal confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience\nis already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and\nthis final battle is even more intense than those from the other films.\nThis climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the\ntrilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually\nchanging between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land\n(including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space\n(including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the\nnew Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is\nreally intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that\nwill determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape.\nAlthough I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit\nfar-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a\ndistraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the\nstormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is\nalso a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be\nquite as stunning as that of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but still complete a\nvery spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of \"A New Hope\" and\nthe more sinnister tone of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", this film really\ncompletes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special\nEdition for \"Return of the Jedi\" concentrated on what would have been nice\nto change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years\nof technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of\ndeterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is\nthe occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good.\nThe gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a\nhuge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the\nsuspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame\nending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning\nthe entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case\nof the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it\ndeserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since\nit's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big,\noutstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.\n"

Return of the Jedi is clearly the\nleast impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal\ninconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard\nMarquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the\ndeparture of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because\nhe and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take\npriority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell\nbecause Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places."

When Luke enters it gets only better, the dark and\nmysterious entrance being great. Now a true Jedi, Skywalker has no need\nfor a blaster and simply uses the force to silence his\nfoes....PERFECT!!! The Rancor was a nice monster but the next scene is\neven better at the pit of 'Sarlac' where Luke nearly single handily\ndefeats Jabba and co.

The themes and messages of redemption and\ngood vs. evil are superbly done here. \"Return of the Jedi\" is a very\nexciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times,\nespecially now that Episode III has been made. It's not as perfect as\nthe previous two Star Wars films were, but it is a very pleasing and\nhappy conclusion to an amazing story.

I love\nwhen a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was\nimpressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed\nastonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is\ntortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be\ndestroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark\nmaster. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is\nimpressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle\nships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the\nnew race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the\nsullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite\nscenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is\nfatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and\nthen it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene\nin Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord."

The film is relentlessly violent and disturbing but\nhonors the life of the late Chris Kyle in a very admirable way. It\ndoesn't show this man as an invincible legend, it shows him as a mere\nman with a heart and soul that are clearly broken due to his sacrifice\nfor his country. Bradley Cooper delivers the best performance of his\ncareer as Chris Kyle. Cooper didn't merely bulk up for the role, he\nbecame this man without any hesitation and doesn't hit a false note.\nClint Eastwood proves that he can still deliver a phenomenal film even\nin his mid-eighties. It isn't only impressive for his age, but American\nSniper is an impressive film in general. It doesn't wallow in classic\nwar film clich\u00e8s, it tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the book\nand while some creative liberties were taken in telling the story\nregarding pacing, it is an excellent film. It isn't an all out war film\nlike The Hurt Locker, it is a heavy drama with plenty of gut wrenching\nscenes both on and off the battle field. The most interesting part of\nthis film is the parallels between Kyle's life as a sniper and Kyle's\ndeteriorating life state side. It is an interesting dynamic to add to a\nfilm like this and echoes past films from the 70s such as Coming Home\nand The Deer Hunter. On a technical level, American Sniper sores with\ngreat cinematography that is a bit more colorful when compared to\nEastwood's past films and excellent sound design. You see every wound\nand hear every gunshot with realistic velocity. It is a truly great\ncinematic experience. Overall, American Sniper is a great film that\nwill tug at your heart strings much like last year's Lone Survivor and\neven goes one step beyond that film and gives us grade A entertainment\nwith grade A acting. It stands as one of the best films of the year.\n"

Now I would probably won't consider this a war\nfilm because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent\nwar films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I\nthought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly\ndramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley\nCooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's\nbest movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were\nhandled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film\nwere the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but\nit's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the\nmain character. The story is mostly just learning about one character.\nThere really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan\nof war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out.\n"

It's not flashy, and it tells the story without adding to\nit like Hollywood tends to do with all war movies, especially ones\nabout the recent wars our men have served in. You feel like you know at\nleast a portion of what a sniper and his Seal team went through while\nserving in the Iraq War. But, most importantly, it also tells the story\nof an Extraordinary Man, a true American Hero, who devoted much of his\nlife to his country, taking multiple tours to keep \"his men\" safe, and\nto protect his country. What an extraordinary movie. I can't say enough\nabout it. Everyone should see this movie. See what this man did for our\ncountry. I would also recommend staying through the credits. All the\nfilm shown during the ending credits is from actual newsreels. An\nexcellent movie. I wholly recommend it."

I do\nbelieve that many of the people writing these types of reviews have not\neven seen the movie, and are essentially acting upon a Pavlovian reflex\nto hate and curse all things pro-American-yes; this crowd's handlers\ncertainly have their drones well trained. While it is true that\nEastwood has handled his directorial duties with a more subtle hand in\nthe past, this is a well-directed, well-acted effort that deserves its\nOscar nominations, but will probably not win the biggies. Chris Kyle's\nstory is compelling and gut-wrenching, poignant, sad, and uplifting.\nBradley Cooper deserves the best acting nod. While modern-day Hollywood\nloves to spit out blood, gore, ultra-violence, and soul-rotting\nperversion for every taste, all in the name of \"entertainment\" (ala\nRome before the fall), nothing offends that community and its\nsupporters more than a non-satiric, non-revisionist, look at a subject\nlike patriotism, family values, or any theme based in Judeo-Christian\nmorality.

According to the film, during military tours in Iraq in the\nearly 2000's, Kyle had 160 kills to his name, mostly males, but\nsometimes females and even children. Was Kyle engaging in right and\nmoral behavior whose efforts should be applauded because he protected\nhis fellow soldiers and helped wrest Iraq from Saddam Hussein? Or was\nhe a brutal mass murderer, whose exploits should have brought him\nbefore an international tribunal for crimes against humanity? However,\nI think the point of this film is to answer neither of those questions.\nThis is simply Kyle's story."

In other words, they should make you\nwant to stay as far the hell away from the hell of war as possible. By\nthis standard, director Clint Eastwood's \"American Sniper\" (hereafter\n\"AS\") is at least partially a good movie. Even though its protagonist,\nChris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), appears to be a decent, good-old-boy,\npatriotic Texan eager to enlist in the U.S. Navy and become a Navy SEAL\nafter hearing of U.S. embassy bombings, his Iraqi Gulf War military\nexperiences, I don't think, would make most people want to visit Iraq\nand kill terrorists. Nevertheless, \"AS\" also seems to retain some of\nthe gung-ho spirit of straightforward pre-Vietnam movies to make the\ncase that this is a \"worthwhile\" war in the sense that it was necessary\nto protect American security. Perhaps AS is both straightforward and\nambiguous, both in its depiction of wartime heroics and atrocities, and\nits depiction of a soldier that revels in, and is damaged by, his role\nas a sniper."

It may seem the\n\"same\" gangster stuff with his moves and faces we all know well, but it\nis also different, deeper, wider. And, it delivers a nice message. So,\nDe Niro is surely not one of those actors who have to accept any role\njust to survive. He can select what to do, and if at the beginning of\nthe movie I thought \"why did you accept to do once again an\nover-the-top sort of gangster which you did 10000 times and adds\nnothing more to your repertoire?\", now I am sure that he accepted this\nrole because he believed in it, as I do now too. All other actors were\nalso very good, specially Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whom I do not mean to\nreduce to a \"mix of Javier Bardem and Bruce Willis\", but he does indeed\nremember me of both. This is not a masterpiece and it does not shake\nthe art of Cinema, but it is a very nice movie which flows fast and\ndoes not leave you empty.\n"

He appeals to The Pope, and The Pope turns\nhim down without a qualm. Robert De Niro makes a glacially cold villain\nwho smokes electronic cigarettes now because he is about to die and his\nown daughter Sydney (Kate Bosworth of \"Straw Dogs\") wants nothing to do\nwith either his fortune or him. Meantime, another casino employee named\nCox (Dave Bautista of \"Spectre\") approaches Vaughn about sticking up\nthe casino. Cox brings along two other thugs and Vaughn briefs him at a\nlocal diner about how they can pull off the heist. The heist itself\ngets off to a rough start because they have to kill one employee and\nthen one of their own panics and leaves them high and dry in the\nparking lot as he careens off in their getaway car. The Pope's chief\nmuscle, Dog (Morris Chestnut of \"Identity Thief\"), goes after Vaughn\nand company with a vengeance. Matters aren't helped because one of them\nwinds up wounded, and they have to scramble for transportation. They\nwind up hijacking a bus driving by Bernie (D.B.

                "reviews": "\nReview: This movie seemed a bit safe because we have all seen this type\nof concept before but I still enjoyed the film and the acting wasn't\nthat bad. It's about a casino worker, Luke Vaughn (Jeffrey Dean\nMorgan), who desperately needs money to pay for an operation that his\ndaughter needs to save her life. Out of desperation, he turns to casino\nowner Francis \"The Pope\" Silva (Robert DeNiro), for the cash but he\nturns him down, which leaves Luke in a tricky situation. After seeing\nall of the cash that goes through the casino, Cox (Dave Bautista)\noffers Luke the opportunity to rob the casino and when Pope turns down\nLuke for the loan, he takes the job and they put together the\nperfection plan, with Cox's 2 close friends, Julian Dante (Stephen\nCyprus Sepher) and Mickey (Tyson Sullivan). On the night of the\nrobbery, they manage to put $3 million in bags, after cutting the power\nbut when they try and escape with the cash, they bump into Pope's main\nhenchman, Dog (Morris Chestnut), which leads to a shootout in the\ncasino. Dante gets shot while there trying to make it to the getaway\ncar and when they finally reach the pick up point, they see Mickey\ndriving away in a panic because of the shots being fired from The Dog\nand the casinos security. They then jump on the nearest bus and they\ntake the passengers hostage, whilst being chased down by the police\nwith the loot. Luke talks to the police officer who is taking chase,\nKrizia (Gina Carano) and he shows sympathy towards the passengers but\nCox is in a panic about getting caught and he tries to help Dante, who\nis in a lot of pain. They then see that the bus is running out of fuel,\nso Luke asks for a fuel truck for the exchange of 2 of the passengers.\nAfter a successful transaction, they try to make there way to Texas to\nmeet up with Cox's friend, but there journey is interrupted when a\ncorrupt cop, Detective Marconi (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), who works for\nPope, kills Dante with a lethal injection whilst offering him help with\nhis injuries. Cox desperately wants to Marconi but Luke knows that\nthere life's wouldn't be worth living if they killed a cop, so they\nthrow him off the bus. The chase then continues and the police manage\nto stop the bus by shooting out the wheels after sending in an elite\nsquad team. Cox then holds the bus driver at gunpoint and threatens to\nkill him if the cops don't let them go but Luke doesn't want to kill\nany innocent people so he kills Cox but everyone thinks that Cox has\nkilled the driver. Luke then gets a call from his daughter and Krizia\ntells him that she knows about everything. As he saved the drivers\nlife, he comes up with the idea to exchange the bus being fixed for\nletting most of the hostages go, so the police accept the trade and the\nbus carries on its journey. Luke manages to get of the bus with the\nhostages but the police are still chasing the bus, hoping to find the\nrobbers. Luke then tries to get to safety but he comes face to face\nwith the Dog, who takes him to the Pope. They then realise that the bag\nof cash is empty because Luke had given the cash to one of the\npassengers, who was acting as if she was pregnant and turned out to be\nhis sister. Krizia sees her giving the money to a doctor to pay for\nLuke's daughters operation but she turns a blind eye because she knows\nthat he had good intentions. As the Pope had a troubled relationship\nwith his daughter, because of his dodgy business dealings, he stops Dog\nfrom killing Luke by shooting him. He then let's Luke go and he calls\nKrizia to find out how his daughter is doing and once he finds out that\nthe doctors are preparing her for her operation, he knows that the\nwhole crazy situation wasn't for nothing. It's not the most original\nstoryline and it did have \"Speed\" written all over it but there is a\nsense of tension throughout the movie, which made it a decent watch.\nAlthough the movie made a big lose at the box office, it really isn't\nthat bad and it's basically what it says on the tin. You can't go wrong\nwith DeNiro playing a gangster and Bautista as a thug so the casting\nwasn't bad but the storyline could have done with some originality or\nsome major twists. Watchable!"

And considering, this movie does not have the cast,\nscript and directing excellence of better flicks like Heat (1995),\nRonin (1998) or even The Score (2001) -following in the same line- I\nwas surprise the movie was above expectations and gives you enough\nentertaining for the 93 minutes's experience. His character on this one\nis called \"The Pope\" and managed to show some \"sprinkles\" of his old\nelectricity, magnetism and humanity of some of his best action-\ngangster roles. Just do not raise expectation high and try not to find\nDe Niro's brilliant performances from the 90's and before. After all,\nyou have a miscast of Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Marconi, the main cop),\nD.Batista (Cox, the tough guy)and Gina Carano (Kris, the female cop). A\nplot with some holes...but with a surprising unusual ending. And of\ncourse, an inexperienced Director. Maybe, Harvey Keitel as the leading\ncop and some Diane Lane as female cop would make a big difference. But\nthat of course, would rise our expectations as well. By the way,\nJ.D.Morgan (Vaughn, lead role) does a decent and believable\nperformance...despite the fact it is also a miscast. Enjoy your\npopcorn, adjust expectations and you will be fine.\n"

Not everyone is straight up 100% good\nor 100% evil, but the circumstances pushed them to make certain\nchoices.

I am glad Jeffrey Dean Morgan is back as\nthe leading character, not that I think he is a amazing actor or\nanything like that. He just seems like a really likable guy in real\nlife. Same goes for Dave Bautista. This is a passable movie for a\nstraight to DVD, but I would never see it in theaters. It just isn't\nworth it. It's passable for a rental, but not one of the top movies to\nrent out. It isn't a awful movie, but it's still easily forgettable and\ndoesn't bring anything new to this genre. And like most of these\nstraight to DVD like movies, some of the action sequences and decisions\ndon't make much sense. I however did like one of the message in this\nmovie, which I thought was impactful. It goes somewhere along the lines\nof \"Love is built on sacrifice, not dollars\"."

The movie in question has Robert De\nNiro and randomly witty use of flashbacks, but uneven script and\nunrealistic solution together with obvious references to famous heist\nand other action movies (e.g. Speed) make it just another brick in the\nwall in the line of them. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Luke Vaughn is\npleasant, but not stronger than De Niro - what the script anticipates,\nand other performances are just trivial, not bad, but just as you might\nexpect. Due to the length and intensive ending, however, you can still\nwatch with without blah! feelings."

It is not award level in any way and logic defying in many ways\nbut its hard to find movies that do not get general wide release as\ngood as this similar to the recent \"Mississippi Grinder\". Jefrrey Dean\nMorgan is simply outstanding as the main hero/anti-hero of the movie.\nThe scene at the final end of the movie (with no spoilers) really got\nto me which does not happen in a movie that generally is a no screen\nrelease to limited release flick. The main thing is the cast is so top\nnotch and a well done action heist that it takes it to a higher level.\nTruthfully 10 years ago the cast would have elevated this to a wide\nrelease movie but the industry is so blockbuster oriented these movies\nhave little chance."

Casual moviegoers and superhero fans will find\nsomething to enjoy. Man of Steel has great wreck- everything action\nthat makes full use of 3D effects and simply looks awesome. The story\nis decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon\nand Russell Crow(e). The character Perry White wasn't used to his full\npotential, but that's forgivable. If you're a fan of classic superman,\nyou might be disappointed by the fact that this man of steel is pretty\nup- tight. He has only two or three lines that are humorous, making him\nless charming then the Christopher Reeve superman. The charm is\nreplaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when\nhe must choose between his past and his future. (that makes for an\nawesome showdown, by the way.) To summarize, I give Man of Steel an 8.6\nfor it's portrayal of a classic American hero.\n"

I\nshould warn you, I think the best Superman adaptation has been in\nanimation, especially the animated series of the 90s with Tim Daly as\nSuperman. Superman is always the boy scout, the Captain America of the\nDC Universe, honest, noble, brave and true. This is not the case in Man\nof Steel. The filmmakers were confused by Nolan. Nolan created a\nrealistic and dark, brooding Batman series. Here is the problem. Batman\nis not realistic. And neither is Superman. You can't make Superman a\ndark, brooding individual who's confused about who he is."

Nolan's work\nwith the Batman movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing and he\nhas one eye for a tragic superhero story.

I'd love to get\nan original copy of the script so I could read the dialogue over and\nover; as someone with a short attention span, four pages is perfect.\nAnd I like the intellectual thrill of reading \"and then ___ punches ___\nfor the other 156 pages. The subtle political messages of this movie\nare so important for our generation, like the expenditure of finite\nnatural resources and the fact that no matter how many little people\nget sacrificed in pursuit of a greater enemy such as General Zod, the\nfate of the world is better served without his overacting. I loved the\nemotional intensity when Clark turns to General Zod and says \"You're a\nmonster...I'm going to stop you.\" I also loved the last seventeen\nsuperhero movies that used the same line. As someone who was born in\nKansas, it truly warmed the cockles of my heart to see it portrayed as\nsuch an upstanding paragon of American patriotism - that, and fat,\nsmall-minded ginger kids who victimize people until they realize the\nerror of their ways and settle down to pathetic, menial jobs and eating\nat IHOP (and other people with bad teeth). The more important thing is\nthat we saw KU playing ball. I felt like the moral dilemmas were so\nreal, yet they are as timeless as Plato, which Clark so obviously read\nand understood when he exercised his godlike powers to level a city and\nkill thousands of innocent bystanders - clearly, that was the ideal\nform of the state that Plato envisaged, united under the martial rule\nof a tyrant in tights. At least he understood the chain of command, and\ngot military authorization first. If my family member had been part of\nthe collateral damage, it would alleviate my grief to know that a\nsuperior being had considered whether my loss was at least\nproportional, as I'm sure it comforts families in Pakistan. Superman\nhas always been such a good guy; I like the change where he doesn't\nsave people any more, it's so much cooler when he's a thug and\nextra-judicial assassin. And even though Lois and Clark only spent\nabout fifteen minutes of the almost three hour movie on screen\ntogether, it in no way cooled the passion of their first-basing on top\nof the rubble and corpses of Metropolis. I was so glad that they\ndisposed of conventional ideas of Superman, like narrative, foundation,\nmotive, character development, and plot continuity. They really seemed\nto focus on realism - nothing so implausible as Kryptonite - just a\ncodex that has the genetics of every future Kryptonian pre-programmed.\nBut all that I've said falls woefully short of the grandeur of the\nactual film - the incoherence of this review cannot possibly outrival\nit.\n"

                "reviews": "\n2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain\nAmerica: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future\nPast'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being\nabsent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of\nFuture Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both\nthe 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe,\ncombining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel\nallowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and\nfuture. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed\nwith some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside\neach other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best\nfilm to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest\nsuperhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick\nthat combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and\nentertaining film.\n"

Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is\nrich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every\nside of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones\nwho are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and\nbigotry only add to the depth of this film.

                "reviews": "\nAfter the disappointing and directionless X3: The Last Stand and the \r\nabysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prospects for the continuation of the \r\nfranchise had gone from great to grim in just a few short years. \r\nDesperate to breathe life back into the series, 20th Century Fox turned \r\nto director Bryan Singer to help right the ship, and although Singer \r\ndidn't return to the director's chair, he oversaw production of X-Men: \r\nFirst Class, an origin story centered on the friendship between Charles \r\nXavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) in their \r\nearly years.\r\n\r\nA critical and commercial success, First Class set the stage for an \r\nexpanded X-Men universe featuring younger versions of the mutant \r\nsuperheroes, but many fans still clamored for more adventures featuring \r\nthe original cast. With Singer back at the helm, X-Men: Days of Future \r\nPast aims to balance precariously between the two, giving the original \r\non screen mutants one last chance to shine, while simultaneously \r\npushing the younger generation forward, and fixing a few glaring \r\ncontinuity errors along the way.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a tremendous action sequence in the near future, \r\nwhere an army of mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels have driven the \r\nX-Men underground. This sequence of events was set into motion some 50 \r\nyears earlier, when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Bolivar \r\nTrask, a military scientist and anti-mutant activist whose experimental \r\nSentinel program would only be accelerated by his untimely demise.\r\n\r\nWith only a handful of their kind remaining, and their numbers \r\ndwindling seemingly by the second, the elder Xavier (Patrick Stewart) \r\nand Magneto (Ian McKellan) discover that Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) has \r\nthe ability to transport a person's consciousness into their younger \r\nself. It's a painful experience, one that Xavier is far too fragile to \r\nwithstand, but thanks to his innate healing ability, Wolverine (Hugh \r\nJackman) is the perfect candidate to be sent back to alter the events \r\nthat led to the destruction of the mutant race.\r\n\r\nWaking up in his 1973 body, Wolverine is tasked with tracking down and \r\nreuniting Xavier and Lensherr to stop the assassination of Trask. Easy \r\nenough, right? Unfortunately, Xavier has become a bitter, reclusive \r\nalcoholic, wasting away in his mansion with his only remaining friend, \r\nHank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), while Lensherr is incarcerated in the most \r\nsecure building in the United States after being implicated in the \r\ndeath of President Kennedy. After all, as Xavier puts it, \"who else \r\ncould curve a bullet?\"\r\n\r\nGetting Lensherr out of trouble is a seemingly impossible task, but \r\nWolverine knows a guy. That guy is the young Pietro Maximoff, better \r\nknown as Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and his handful of scenes are some \r\nof the most entertaining moments in the film, particularly an escape \r\nsequence that conveys his super-speed abilities by shooting at 3000 \r\nframes per second. There have been glimpses of this moment during the \r\nfilm's trailers, but the scene as a whole is staggeringly beautiful, \r\nand the character's bizarre sense of humor provides a sense of joy and \r\nplayfulness that are noticeably absent from the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say X-Men: Days of Future Past is not enjoyable - on the \r\ncontrary, it's a thrilling experience from start to finish, with plenty \r\nof emotional resonance to go along with all the action and special \r\neffects. Jackman's performance is less growling menace and more wise \r\nmediator, adding yet another dimension to an already complex character. \r\nMcAvoy and Fassbender still have remarkable chemistry, but the film \r\ntruly belongs to Lawrence, whose ability to emote through layers of \r\nbody paint and prosthetics makes Mystique more relatable than ever \r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhile it's a shame that most of the original X-Men cast are relegated \r\nto cameos, those minor appearances tend to come during jaw-dropping \r\naction scenes. The futuristic battles between the Sentinels and the \r\nlast remaining mutants are a joy to behold, with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) \r\nfinally using his abilities in ways that fans have always wanted to \r\nsee, and newcomers like Blink (Fan Bingbing) and Bishop (Omar Sy) \r\ngetting an opportunity to kick ass alongside the veterans.\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of references to the previous X-Men films, as \r\nDays of Future Past attempts to bridge the gap between the original \r\ntrilogy and the reboot. William Stryker (Josh Helman) is a looming \r\npresence throughout the film, with his work evoking images of the \r\nWeapon X program, and the final moments are full of fan service cameos \r\nthat effectively close the book on the original characters. For the \r\nmost part, it succeeds, and while there are still a few questions \r\nremaining, there's so much to love here that the minor details no \r\nlonger feel relevant.\r\n\r\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is a return to form for Singer, whose \r\ndirectorial efforts since the first two films have been rather poorly \r\nreceived. His emotional connection to the material and his love for the \r\ncharacters has never been more evident, and the X-Men have never been \r\nmore compelling or entertaining. This latest installment proves there's \r\nstill plenty of life left in the franchise, and we can't wait to see \r\nwhat comes next when the mutants return in 2016.\r\n\r\n-- Brent Hankins\n"

James McAvoy puts in a superb\nperformance as an embittered Professor X and there are great\nperformances from Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in their\nrespective roles as Wolverine and Magneto but the person everyone is\ngoing to be talking about is a new mutant to the series called\nQuicksilver played superbly with the right amount of arrogance and\nlikability by Evan Peters. His huge action scene where he is required\nto rescue an imprisoned Magneto from a heavily guarded Pentagon is an\nabsolute delight and already a contender of most amazing action scene\nof the year and I cant see anything beating it. Trust me - you will\nwant to watch this scene again and again as there is so much to marvel\nat. Pity that Quicksilver is absent after this as the film does sorely\nmiss the character. Hoping to see more of him in the future. The film\ndoes have a great climax though featuring a highly inventive use of a\nfootball stadium and a post credits scene with a hint of what to expect\nin the next movie. All in all a great movie that is going to delight\nand entertain young and old alike.\n"

                "reviews": "\n(Spoiler Warning) I'm really scratching my head on this one guys, this\nmovie's been hailed as \"The best x-men movie ever!\" I'm sorry, but I\nREALLY have to disagree on this one. Before I state all the reasons why\nI hated this movie, let me start off with two positive comments: Hugh\nJackman is still good as Wolverine, and the character of Quicksilver,\nwas pretty cool. Now for the numerous reasons as to why I hated this\nfilm. So we start off looking at a destroyed, post apocalyptic,\nlandscape that looks like it was ripped off from the first two\nTerminator movies. We then get some narration from Charles Xavier. He\nexplains that most of the mutant population has been enslaved or killed\nby these killer machines known as sentinels. Then we see a small group\nof mutants who are both hiding, and trying to fight the sentinels.\nXavier tells them that the only chance for the mutant race to survive,\nis to go back in time to try to prevent the assassination of a\ngovernment scientist, which in turn prevents the deployment of the\nsentinels. So Wolverine is sent back through time, and must prevent\nfellow mutant Mystique, from doing the deed. You would think that a\nplot involving time travel would be intriguing and interesting right?\nWell not in this movie! There's almost no action, The actors are bland,\nand you couldn't care less for any of the characters! That's only the\ntip of the iceberg folks! What really kills it is the fact the the plot\nhas more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese! Before I talk about\nthat though, let me back up a bit. When \"X-men first class\" came out, I\nthought to myself: Okay cool, they're rebooting the x-men franchise and\nmaking a whole new series.\" Turns out they weren't, the only reason why\n\"X-Men first class was made, was so that they could create a whole new\ncontinuity that they could smash together with the old continuity. The\nresult of this, is a clusterf*cked mess! This film won't leave you\nfeeling good or entertained, it will only leave you with a head full of\nquestions. Such as these: Why is Xavier alive in the future, when we\nclearly saw him being killed by the phoenix in part 3? Why does\nWolverine have bone claws in the past, but metal claws in the future?\nWhy does Xavier claim to have known Mystique since she was a child,\nwhen there was no indication of that in the original films? Why does\nWolverine claim that in the future he and Hank McCoy (Beast) are\nfriends when there was no previous indication of that? In the climax of\nthe film, the sentinels have already been built. Even though they\nsucceed in their mission, what's there to stop someone else from using\nthem? How does Wolverine survive for so long underwater? Did Mystique\nperform the adamantium experiments on Wolverine? Why and how are\nCyclops and Jean Grey alive again at the end? This movie doesn't even\nso much as attempt to answer any of the questions that it leaves the\nviewer with! Frankly, it would be easier to solve a Rubik's cube on LSD\nthan it would be be to figure this movie out! So far, I've never been\nimpressed with ANY of the X-men films. 1 and 2 were lame, 3 was\ngarbage, and this one was even worse! I'm done with this franchise! I\ndon't care what they do with the next film, I've put up with all the\nincompetence I can take! From now on, it's just the x-men comics and\ncartoons for me. Sorry 20th century fox, but you guys blew it!\n"

The Wolverine is only\nthere to get a ball rolling and create this change. Erik and Xavier are\nstill having the same argument they are making in every other film and\nMystique still doesn't know who to side with. She can't decide what she\nwants to be. She has to choose her own path. Mystique is brilliantly\nacted in this film by Jennifer Lawrence. I loved her portrayal in First\nClass and anyone should be glad about this performance because she\nturns into Rebecca Romijn. James McAvoy falls away in this role and\nequally brilliant in his role is Michael Fassbender. Each of these men\ngive the characters a dynamic that is so much better in this film. The\nweaknesses of some of the first films is the fact that the didn't get a\nlot of screen time together, but in this film they get to play out\ntheir struggles to each other and fight over their beliefs. Mystique is\nin the middle and she has to fight the both of them. Magneto is the\nvillain of the past in this film and it is so great to see that he\nstill the same Magneto that we love. A man who is hurt from his\nexperiences. Nicholas Hoult is also really cool as Beast and his change\nis also explained. Hoult is there as a support for Xavier and it takes\na talent to be able to handle your own against Hugh Jackman. Hugh\nJackman is Huge Jacked Man. He is the most fit person I have ever seen\nin my life and is brilliant in his role as Wolverine. Hugh takes this\nto a new level and his also added dimension. Trask is a villain that\nyou get what he is doing and has a clear motivation that I really\nenjoyed. Peter Dinklage's height is pleasantly absent from the script\nand is satisfying for this character and actor. You don't like Trask,\nbut you can see where he is coming from. Peter is even one of the best\nparts of the film. His comedy and action blows you out of the water.\nThe hint at the his relations to Magneto and it isn't very overbearing\nabout it. His action scene is also so good that it is on the level of\nNightcrawler's raid on The White House."

                "reviews": "\nThis is the best movie in the series and of the year! Let me start off\nby saying I'm a huge fan of the x-men. I read the comics, I watched the\n90's cartoon, their my favorite comic book title from Marvel and 2nd\nonly to batman. The x-men film series is my personal favorite film\nseries of all-time! I think 20th century fox has done a great job\nhandling the series and I'm happy with every installment. But even\nthough I couldn't wait to see this movie I was a little worried about\nthe time line & continuity in this film, there were already continuity\nissue starting with \"first class\" but Singer said he wanted to fix\nthose problems. And since this film has wolverine going back to 1973, I\nwas worried about how that fits with \"origins\" and I was also worried\nabout the fact that the sentinels were created in the 70's but no where\nto be found in the original x-men trilogy. But I'm very happy to say\nthat the story works perfectly and dosen't really contradict the other\nfilms! Before I talk about the great actors and special effects I must\ntalk about how great the story is and Singer did \"fix\" the continuity.\nFirst off they explained how professor X was able to walk after getting\nparalyzed in \"first class(FC) because that was one of the major\ncontinuity problems in that we saw Xaviar get paralyzed in \"FC\" but in\nflashbacks of \"origins\" & \"last stand\" which took place in the 80's he\nwas walking but here they explain he can walk thanks to a serum by Hank\nso that gives a good explanation for that. They did a good job\nexplaining how the sentinels fit into the previous story line, so in\n1973 professor X was depressed & magneto was locked in prison so\nmystique was left on her own and she killed Trask but was briefly\ncaptured where scientist took her blood & 50 years later they used her\nblood to create sentinels that can shape shift to adapt to whoever\ntheir fighting. So that perfectly explains why there were no sentinels\nin the previous x-men films. Mystique killed Trask in '73 so no\nsentinels were created. And they didn't know that mystique's blood\nwould be used to create unstoppable killer robots 50 years later. So in\nthe background of X1, X2, X3 and the wolverine Trask industry was\nworking on bringing back the sentinels until they had the technology to\nuse mystique's blood for the sentinels. But this movie does make me\nwonder what happened in the original time line, I mean how did\nprofessor X get out of his funk & started the school again and how did\nmagneto and mystique get out of custody but the good thing there's\nstill like a 30 year gap between the events of '73 and the 1st x-men\nmovie so a lot could of happened. So seeing a middle age professor X &\nMagneto in a flashback in \"last stand\" where they meet a child Jean\nGrey dosen't seem to be out of place in the continuity. And wolverine\ntraveling back to 1973 dosen't contradict too much with \"origins\".\nWolverine has the bone-claws like in origins and I like how they made\nhim wake-up in the 70's, he had another life going on. I like when the\nwomen called him Jimmy which was revealed to be his real name in\n\"origins\" so I liked that connection. The only problem is that William\nStryker in this film is a young man in his 20's or maybe early 30's but\nin \"origins\" he meets wolverine & Victor in Vietnam & he was in his\n40's. But other then that it fits pretty well. Stryker probably met\nWolverine & Victor in Vietnam and soon after joining him, wolverine\nleft to be alone for 6 years. But since there was no specific year\nshowed in \"origins\" you can be flexible there. My only criticism is\nthat we don't see more of the horrible future but maybe it's for the\nbest 'cause it was pretty dark & sad. But I think they could of\nexplained a little more like how professor X came back alive after\n\"last stand\". I would've liked to see more of storm, iceman, colossus\nand Bishop. But at least we got to see them do some cool stuff with\ntheir powers. All the actors did a great job & despite playing\nwolverine for 6 movies Jackman is still awesome, his gruff personality\nis so appealing and I like that even in the horrible future he's still\nsmoking his cigars. McAvoy & Fassbender are perfect as the younger\nXaviar & Magneto. Peter Dinkalege is great as Bolivia Trask. I like how\nWilliam Stryker works into story. I love the look of the sentinels, the\n\"future ones\" look really scary and the \"past ones\" looks perfect to\nthe iconic comic book version. The plot is unpredictable and leaves you\nwith doubt about if they can save the future. It's a really well\nwritten story with great emotional depth & strong performances from\neveryone. I love Jennifer Lawerence as mystique. I love the actor\nplaying quicksilver, his look & personality was just like in the\ncomics, he was funny and stoled every scene. I love how they hinted at\nmagneto being his father like in the comics. I love the cameos at the\nend by Kelsey Grahmer as beast, James Mardeson as cyclops, the hot Anna\nPaquin as rogue and the sexy Famake Janeson as Jean Grey, as well as a\ncameo by Bryan Singer himself. Although it's kinda sad to know that the\nfirst 3 x-men movies didn't happen but at least wolverine remembers it.\nI like how the movie ended with many possibilities, no specific\ndirection for the sequel. I love the post credit scene showing the next\nvillain, \"apocalypse\" in ancient Egypt being worshiped as a god. A\ngreat film in a classic film series!\n"

                "reviews": "\nIt's not too out there to say that the x-men series is in a rut. First\noff the 3rd part of the original trilogy was lacking something, but was\nstill okay\u0085 Then came X-men first class, that was good on in a lot of\nways, but was also filled with mistakes. Despite the fact that Fox was\nlooking to make a romantic-comedy-action for teenagers the end result\nwasn't that bad. But to me it did succeed in \u0096 despite the great actors\n\u0096 making me like the new foundation x-men was set on. Then came the\nworst installment of the x-men saga Wolverine. I think the whole brand\nreached its lowest point with that film, despite the fact that it's a\nwatchable film, but it was by far the worst of them all. Of course the\nfilms make money but Avengers proved that there is a whole lot more\nmoney to be made still with comic book films. Of course Fox wanted a\npiece of the pie too, but I'm sure they knew that you need quality to\nmake lots of money, so they invested a lot and secured Bryan Singer for\nthe director's chair. He was already around to produce and write First\nClass but this time around he got control of the whole film. Fox then\nokayed the x-men series most complex story for the film. Thought the\nscript was written by Simon Kinberg, who already fell short with the 3\npart back in the day but for some reason Singer trusted him with it.\nFirst off the film is good, maybe even the best yet. Of course the\nbiggest question everyone has been asking is will it give the Avengers\na run for its money and that's a harder question to answer. Compared to\nother comic book adaptations and other Marvel films the two are very\ndifferent, so it's hard to compare them, but I have to point out the\nquality wise it's up there with Ironman. I don't think that it will be\nthere money wise. They did rewrite the original story from the comic\nbook, but that didn't cause problems. I was mostly worried about how\nthey would sew the 5 x-men films together but that was done perfectly.\nSo the story is okay. As is the script. There are humorous parts, but\nthey aren't over the top. Just enough. The actors are genius, none of\nthem forgot how to act since the previous installments. This was a give\nthough cause the casting was always super. Evan Peters as Quicksilver\nis so good, that it almost becomes his one man show. I maybe just\nexpected a little more from Peter Dinklage. Let's look at the other\ncharacters, as opposed to the other films Wolverine isn't completely in\nthe main focus, and the funny thing is that this isn't a problem.\nMagneto, Xavier and Mystic step up to the plate, but just to sooth the\nfans he doesn't fade into the background. But this still brings us to\none of the problems, there is not enough time for all the characters;\nIt's one team but two time zones, some characters got larger roles like\nMystic, and a few were left to fade away, but Singer manage to fix this\nproblem, way better than with x-men 2 by having huge action scenes in\nthe film. They are done well and are brutal. So we don't really have\ntime to get into which characters are lost in the background. You're\njust whiplashed by the action, action that is not the least bit\npointless. There is always a believable story behind each one. All in\nall it's a step forward from First Class, and it was a quality step\ntoo. It's not just a 5th part. Which is huge. So I give it a 9/10 Max -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1\n"

This movie follows 4\ngirls who do despicable acts, who behave with such depravity and who\nare shallow to the core, that watching this can be painful at times.\nBut that is the whole point and people who walk out of this feeling as\nthough they have had their time robbed of them or are too disgusted by\nwhat they see are missing the point. I am not an elitist movie critic\nin no sense of the word either, but I know a shock movie when I see\none."

The writing in this\nmovie is terrible and makes no sense at all. Selena Gomez is supposed\nto be a very Christian girl with high morals and ends up drinking tons\nof alcohol, does drugs, and encourages robbery. She then tells her\nGrandma that she should come with her to spring break next year\nimplying that she should drink do drugs and have sex with random people\ntoo. Selena Gomez is trying to find out who she really is during spring\nbreak and that turns out to be a drunk slut. Her friends however are\nfar worse and apparently are now cold blooded killers. These girls in\ncollege could have a good future but decide they want to have sex with\nJames Franco and get money in any way possible. One girl gets shot and\ngets afraid and goes home and the other two decide to stay. I guess\nthey don't care if they are going to die or not. These two girls then\ntell their parents over the phone that they want to turn their life\naround and start being good people is the secret to being happy thus\nimplying that they'll go home and start listening to their own advice\nand get a better life. They then proceed to magically kill tons of\npeople with guns from a gang and steal a very expensive car. The most\nannoying part of this movie is the repetitiveness of everything James\nFranco says. That \"Spring Break\" line that he keeps saying that I'm\nsure Korine finds haunting just sounds ridiculous and annoying. I'm not\nsure what the message of this movie is because nothing in it makes\nsense and nothing is consistent. I can't tell if Korine is advocating\ncompletely hedonistic life-styles or not because while some of the\ngirls feel bad and go back their \"boring lives\" the last two girls get\nlet off with no consequence what-so-ever. This movie to me just seems\nlike a pretentious piece of s**t. That uses a somewhat interesting\npremise and unique cinematography to fool the audience that more is\nbeing said with this movie than there is."

On\nthe contrary, Harmony Korine's film is a bitter satire (at times\ncynical) about the American youth culture and, in large part, global.\nThe shallowness of the characters is deliberate. The three crazy\ntravelers do evil in pure boredom, the banality of evil is presented\nhere in an ironic contrast to the free and unlimited sexuality and drug\nuse, the Holy Grial of these girls. At times, the three chicks seem the\nwitches of Macbeth, messengers of death and emptiness. Harmony Korine\nis a moralist, his film denounces the horror that lurks behind the\nglamour of drugs and free love. But Korine delivers his message with a\nstyle that copies and reproduces the mechanisms of fashion, so that a\nteenager is attracted yet shocked by what you see on the screen.\nWatching this movie, it is impossible not to remember Less Than Zero,\nthe novel that enabled Bret Easton Ellis earn his place under the\nCalifornia sun. The state of affairs is certainly catastrophic for\nKorine: a. The pursuit of happiness is reduced to get lost in a\nperpetual orgy. b. The perpetual orgy is slightly threatened only by\nreligious zealots as the only challenging force. c. No more parents and\nadults, no more institutions concerned with the physical and mental\nhealth of its citizens. d. Youngsters' paradise is depicted as one of\nthe many faces of hell.\n"

                "reviews": "\nHonestly, if this is this generation coming to age's film; I have\nlittle to no hope for humanity. This movie was pretty bad. Directed and\nwritten by Harmony Korine, the film highlights the mindless U.S popular\ncultural event known as 'Spring Break'. Spring Break serves as a break\nfrom the social norms, where youth can relax from the stresses of life.\nOver the years, Spring Breaks celebrating in Florida with each\ngeneration has got more extreme and stupid. I don't have a problem with\nSpring Break, as it's does boost the local economy, but I do see this\nsort of party fascination is blindly controlling youth in the worth\ndirection. Colleges are become less and less about teachings of proper\neducation, and more and more about majority in being a drunken fool,\nlately. I hate dumb young people. The film depicts the shallowness of\none such event, and the extreme examples of letting loose of society\ncontrol. It's pretty sad to see four gifted smart college students\nallowing themselves to do dumb things that seems 'cool' because of\nthese YOLO phenomenon. Ideas like long drinking binges, whoring\nthemselves out, and lots of drug use. These bad behaviors are cause by\ntwo factors: A fear of not being good enough (the fear of failure) &\nthe fear that his or her life's not going to be good enough (the fear\nof loss). Sadly, this movie doesn't explain it well. There is little to\nno amount of intellectually subtle social commentary in this movie.\nIt's not even that thought-provoking. It gives no insight, message, or\nunderlying theme. I found this to be the most depressing part of the\nfilm. We never truly know why this girls do the most despicable acts\nand behave with such depravity. If the movie had more inside of the\ncharacter's home or school life, maybe we can understand what they're\ngoing through, but no. This movie doesn't know if glorifying the\ndemoralizing activities portrayed, if it is a satire it, or its just\nmindless shock value. It's in no way, a comedy as the majority of the\nsexual, and violence content is actually presented in a dramatic or\nuncomfortable fashion. Very rarely is it meant to be comedic or taken\nlightly. I just have to say, it was painful to watch. No amount of eye\ncandy, and nudity shots can make this movie any better. Most of the\nControversial of this film comes with the fact that the four college\nstudent turn robbers are mostly ex-Disney TV teen idols. Seeing Selema\nGomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine in this film is\na bit disappointing, as they all could had pick better adult themes\nroles. I'm not talking about roles that degraded women to being near\ndumb sex objects like this movie does. They really need to follow the\nEmmas (Emma Stone, Emma Watson, and Emma Roberts, who majority in my\nopinion, start in pretty good movies). Emma Roberts was supposed to\nstart in this film, but dropped out in early 2012, reportedly after\nhearing she would need to gain body fat for her role. Good for her.\nThere is little to no character development, but glad the movie shows\nthat at less two of girls came back to their senses, as less I think.\nSo I guess, that counts. If there is a protagonist in this movie, it\nwould be the development of Faith (Selema Gomez). I doubt this movie\nwill hurt Selema Gomez's movie career. James Franco as the\nweapon-dealing, wannabe rapper Alien is pretty bad in my opinion. I\nknow a lot of people like his performance, but I found it to be\nannoying as hell with his looping voice of Spring Break is forever. At\nless, it wasn't real rapper Riff Raff playing Alien. That would be\nworst off. I give some credit to the movie as some scenes are pretty\nbeautiful shot. I like how it was shot like a weird dream, with its\npoignant use of slow motion, and its use of bright beautiful colors. It\nwas well-shot kinda, with a few scenes that are going a bit too\nsoft-porn. There's a beautifully crafted scene during their robbery of\na restaurant that features one of the girls rolling the car around the\nbuilding, catching glimpses of what they were doing inside. There is\nsomething disturbing about having seeing two maniac women kill people,\nand be OK watching My Little Pony: Friendship is magic. There is a\npretty good scene where Alien is with the girls around a piano singing,\n'Everytime' by Britney Spears. The electronic techno dubstep music by\nSkrillex is pretty catchy. The movie is pretty smart with its\nforeshadowing. It does it with sounds. The movie is broken into roughly\nfour segments, and the transition between each is a specific event that\nhas a distinctive sound. The sound is worked into the edits and shot\nchanges in the scenes leading up to their events. Specifically, sounds\nof crashing and hammering leads up to the fast food robbery, sounds of\nthe jail cell door leads up to the arrest, and sounds of gun fire leads\nup to one of the characters being shot. The bloody ending is a bit a\nstretch of being unrealistic with season gangsters that can't shot at a\ntarget that is wearing bright colors; while a bunch of teenagers with\nno marksmanship skills are able to kill people. I do feel disturb\nseeing a bunch of white girls killing a bunch of black people shortly\nafter the Trayvon Martin killings in 2012 in Sunrise, FL. I doubt the\nproducers care. About the people saying its feminist. I really doubt\nthat, too. Killing men isn't feminist. It's more sexism than ever.\nOverall: I have to say, Spring Breakers isn't the worst movie ever, but\nit's no way, good.\n"

I\nappreciate that the film aims to identify and expose the consumerist\nand media-fuelled world that we now live in, especially for its target\naudience, which I took to be young adults around the age of college\n(Uni) study. For example, Alien's repetition of the words 'spring-break\n(forever)' reflects the repetition of marketing slogans and\nadvertisements that attempt to persuade us that whatever being sold is\namazing and perfect. Director Harmony Korine also highlights the\ndisenchantment of sex and the loss of sexual privacy; it is continually\nassociated with money in this film, as are most things, but it's also\nperformed in public (swimming pool), illustrating its cheap value and\ncommon practice in modern youth culture and media."

The only reason\nfor this was because I knew exactly what I was in for. A lot of people\nthought it was going to be a deep, meaningful movie with a complex plot\nthat comments on today's society. These people were wrong! Spring\nbreakers is a true black and white film that shows what can happen on\nspring break. It was very visually interesting and the violence and\nsexuality was extremely prominent, but what else can you expect from a\nspring break movie. There will obviously be sex and drugs. The acting\nwas decent and the plot was not the greatest, but it was still a great\nmovie. Anybody who saw this movie for the cast or to discover the\nhidden meanings behind it were disappointed because that's not what\nthis movie was made for. Yes this movie has some big names, but if\nthat's all you saw this movie for or all you will see this movie for\nyou will hate it! You have to know what to expect when seeing a movie\nand you can't always expect perfection (you can't expect Lord of the\nRings from a movie like Napoleon Dynamite!) Spring Breakers was not\nperfect, but it was a damn good movie! So just keep in mind that this\nisn't for everyone and keep an open mind while watching it and you'll\nprobably like it too.\n"

However, unlike\nWatchmen, which adhered so closely to its source material that a\nfalling short by comparison proved inescapable, Wolverine's inevitable\nbacklash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its\nsource material. The film casually mutilates and re-writes the comic\nbook context of its source material with the cold disdain of its\nprotagonist, hacking one of the most genuinely compelling, subversive\nand horrifying superhero back-stories into the worst kind of safe,\nfamiliar, PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine's compelling\ncomic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes\nexhilaration for only occasionally impressive fight/chase/explosion\nscenes, complexity for eye-rolling cheese and broad humour, and story\ncohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and\navoid the true dramatic meat of the story.

By far this is the\nbest X men movie made, that brought out the real Marvel X men\nexperience which i loved. Obviously from the first X men movie it self\nwe knew that Hugh Jackman was the perfect Wolverine, and he has turned\nout to e a legend. i don't think anybody else in this world could bring\nout the animal and portrait Logans sensitive side both at the same\ntime. It was brilliant. And it would be a crime if i don't mention the\nspectacular performance by Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth AKA Victor\nCreed. My god he was the Villain of the story, but his reflection of\nsabertooth made all X men fans to fall in love with him. I fell in love\nwith that character. it was like the true cartoon sabertooth from the\n1980's was brought to life. I hated the sabertooth that was in X Men 1.\nit was like a bad soft toy. Finally what made this movie the best X men\nmovie is not the graphics or the effects, or sound, It was the Strong\nStory which happen to be the true story of Wolverine. Don't get me\nwrong though the graphics effects, sounds were excellent. Then as every\nCritic i have a few Criticism's as well. The main thing what i don't\nlike in this move is what they did to dead pool at the end. That never\nhappened!! they made that awesome mutant a freak!! I loved his\nperformance (could've done better) and i love that Character Dead Pool.\nThey could've used him Differently. Having said That overall it was a\nbrilliant movie. All true Old marvel comic X men lovers would worship\nthis movie. I can't wait till they create the next movie and i really\nreally love to see my all time favorite one of the most powerful\nMutants, APOCALYPSE!!!! in it... One Last thing; Only a true old X men\nlover could get the fullest impact on this great movie or should i call\nit the great piece of ART done by Gavin Hood, David Benioff, Skip Woods\nAnd Hugh Jackman?\n"

It gains an advantage because it's a\nwell-tempered introduction of new characters mixed with the perfect\nfocus on the character of Wolverine. The action sequences do indeed\nwarrant serious praise.

                "reviews": "\nX-Men origins: Wolverine the first spin-off/prequel of the X-Men saga\nand maybe the most anticipated of all. The film has a very good\nadaptation, even if you're not into the Wolverine story, you will\nunderstand perfectly. Its a movie full of action from the very first\nminute, a little of drama, some very good moments of humor and even a\nlittle bit of romance and the special effects are excellent. It has a\nfast paced rhythm making the movie interesting and never tiresome. The\ncast is really good, Hugh Jackman for the 4th time in the role of\nWolverine/Logan, he already dominates this character, it just looks so\nnatural on him. Liv Schreiber was excellent as Sabretooth/Victor, he\nmanages the character to the perfection. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor\nKitsch were great as Deadpool/Wade and Gambit/Remy respectively\nalthough I would like to see more screen time from this two characters.\nIn conclusion, this Wolverine movie is enjoyable and entertaining\nenough. I think it will fulfill all the expectations.\n"

Being a fan of the comic books and old cartoons, my\nexpectations for the sequel were very high. X2 didn't let me down,\npassing all the expectations I had for it. It did exactly what the\noriginal film did, but made everything bigger and better. Then, X3\nhappened. Now, Wolverine takes the franchise back to more solid ground\nand adds to the legend by perfectly augmenting X2. It tops X2 in action\nbecause the fight scenes are larger and much better filmed. Overall,\nany X-Men fan should be pleased with this movie. If they're not, they\nwere expecting too much Gambit or the Deadpool from the books. I\nwasn't. So, I'm a pretty happy camper.\n"

The success is mostly\ndue to the action and to Tom Cruise and his winning smile. The aerial\ncombat shown in Top Gun is exciting, but it's not always logical or\nconsistent (shooting down Soviet fighter planes would result in war in\nreal life). What makes it better is the film's soundtrack. Catchy\nupbeat rock & pop songs back the action and the romance on screen.\nThat's pretty much the film's appeal. There are plenty of faults, but\nin the end it's entertaining and makes one feel good. The fighter pilot\nlife seems so appealing in Top Gun that registrations to join the navy\nin the USA went up significantly after the film was released. According\nto the film in order to become one of the top fighter pilots in America\nyou have to be a) a male b) have an attitude c) be good-looking d) be a\ngood fighter pilot. Oh, and you have to believe that America is always\non the side of good. Come to think of it, was there even a brunette in\nthe film? It seemed to me like all the women were blondes. Yeah, but at\nleast the dogfights are some of the best in film history. There's no\nTop Gun program in reality though. Still, while you're there \"playing\nwith the boys\" you feel cool and like you belong. Val Kilmer makes an\nimpression, but it turns out he didn't want to be in the film. He had\nto play the role of Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky because of contract\nobligations. Top Gun is not a bad film. Even if everything in it is by\nthe numbers it's still a notable 1980s flick (in my opinion \"Take My\nBreath Away\" is an annoying and corny song). The film is bright, it's\naction-packed, it's sometimes touching, it's at times funny. I\nrecommend it.\n"

This is just the\ntraining for characters who would go on to see action later that we'll\nmiss. Pardon my mention of Marvel in a review for an 80s film, but look\nat this like a superhero flick. Say, 'Iron Man'. We got to see Tony\nStark's origin story, what made him become Iron Man, then we got to see\nhim become Iron Man and actually fly around getting bad guys. In 'Top\nGun', we get to see Maverick's origin story...and then it's it. Just\nthe origin. We don't see planes having real fights and battles, and\nagain, this is not always a bad thing, this is just what made the movie\nslow-moving.

And\nlater I played the video game Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X, and it kinda feel\nlike a later modern version of Top Gun. Plus, I find the opening\nbackground music loop, \"Ready Aurora\", seriously suitable for the\nopening sequence of Top Gun, from Paramount logo to debrief back on the\nCarrier. Honest Trailer fired on the fact that they used Kenny Loggins'\nDanger Zone three times... well, figure they'll have one less spot to\nhit if they dubbed the first part with looping Ready Aurora. Too bad\nTom Salsa didn't compose that for Top Gun in 1986, that would have been\nepic. I tried that, by the way, and it was good. The story was great as\nwell, even though the closing scene would look really better with a\nkiss. And Maverick chose to become an instructor in the Top Gun\nAcademy... probably the one(or one of his trainees) that trained David\nCrenshaw, the top pilot from H.A.W.X. This is an enticing thought.\n"

A huge hit when it first came\nout in 1986, I, like most others, were thoroughly entertained by the\nfast pace, catchy soundtrack, and exciting aerial dogfight scenes.\nStill am to this day. But there was actually a time when, with\nperspective, I realized that Top Gun was in reality not truly a \"good\"\nfilm, but more of a guilty pleasure type movie. The dialogue is pretty\nstandard, the tale very linear and one-note, the acting nothing to\nwrite home about. Yet, somehow this movie is very iconic due to the\naforementioned positives as well as a few memorable one-liners/moments."

Here is why I think the movie does not suck: The plot of the\nmovie and the story behind it paints a picture of our world (Earth)\ntoday and its socioeconomic mindset, but on a mind boggling universe\ngrand scale. It makes you think how vast the universe is, how many\nspecies (perhaps or most certain) there are out there with more advance\ntechnologies than ours, and it makes you ask yourself: \"If what they\nare doing in the movie, the fact that royalties harvest entire planets\nfor their personal interest and profit, is morally wrong, then why are\nwe humans doing or allowing the exact same thing happening on our own\nplanet? We use each other and that needs to stop. We all share this\nplanet and we need to learn how to co-exist with nature and all life on\nit. What could've been better in the movie is the evolution of the\nplot. It happened too fast and it felt like some parts were missing.\nEither the movie should have been longer in that case, which I would\nnot prefer, or some fighting and action scenes should have been shorter\n(some of those last as long as 5 minutes of pure action - a bit too\nlong). The special effects where outstanding throughout the movie\nexcept in rare occasions it was indistinguishable of what is going on.\nTatum did an OK job, not an outstanding performance but not so bad\neither. Mila Kunis was a bit \"cold\" at times. So to sum it up, the\nreason I gave it an 8/10 is mainly because the plot although it felt\nlike it missed some parts, and the action scenes were a tad too long.\nOther than that, the movie paints a great socioeconomic picture we all\ncan learn from.\n"

The problem\nis that, being only one two-hour film, it has so many great ideas that\nit never gets a chance to develop them fully.

I think the only thing which is a bit\nawkward is the harvesting of the planets ( which they really did it\nright now in reality then ) , but for all the other ideas , they are\nnot new or inventive. This movie reminds me of The chronicles of\nRiddick, a bit of Dune , a bit of the latest Matrix. The acting is\nrather poor and what's worse is the cutting or mixing of some scenes.\nThe storyline is as said simple, almost Cinderella-kind and by God the\ngood ones always are just in time to rescue Mila . Stopped counting how\nmany times that happened. Then the villain is so pathetic that it made\nme laugh. The characters so stereotypic that I can't believe that this\ncame from the same guys who gave us The Matrix. And being fare , The\nMatrix trilogy was also acting with special effects added later, but at\nleast we had good acting. Mila is trying but it's not enough, and the\nscenes are so short that it is impossible for actors to give what they\nare supposed to do. Then there is this scene where she had to register.\nWhat was that all about ? Nicking Terry Gilliams Brazil ? In the end I\ncan only rate this purely on what's good , the effects, images and\ndresses. And that's what this movie is : a dress with no substance in\nit. Sad.\n"

                "reviews": "\n\nSay what you will about George Lucas, you have to give the guy credit for\nsetting himself a difficult task in `Star Wars: Attack of the Clones' (and I\ndo mean beyond trying to deliver a film that will meet the almost impossibly\nhigh expectations of his millions of fanatical followers).   By choosing to\nplace Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point,\nLucas does what few others in this business are willing to do \u0096 which is to\nrisk making a crowd-pleasing epic without a likable central `hero.'  After\nall, since this film is a prequel and not a sequel to the original trilogy,\nwe all know that this brooding young man will end up turning into the\nirredeemably evil Darth Vader.  Of course, Luke Skywalker fulfilled the\nrequirements of conventional hero for the original series and even Han Solo,\nthough he was a bit of a rogue and a scoundrel, always allowed his virtuous\nside to break through when the chips were down.  Anakin, though, for all his\ninternal struggles in this film, is predestined to go over to the Dark Side\n(certainly in the next installment).  The pre-knowledge the audience is\nprivy to from our acquaintance with the later chapters gives the film a kind\nof poignant sadness at times - or at least it would if Lucas had done a\nbetter job as both writer and director in bringing it out.  Unfortunately,\nthe dialogue is so poorly written that Anakin comes across as little more\nthan a petulant, peevish, moony-eyed schoolboy most of the time \u0096 hardly\neither the `greatest Jedi knight' we keep being told he has the potential to\nbecome nor the future Hitlerian dictator we know he will one day be.   His\nromantic, puppy-love interludes with Senator (former Queen) Padme Amidala\nare embarrassing at best.  We have indeed come a long way from the fun love\ntriangle involving Luke, Han and the feisty Princess Leia."

                "reviews": "\n*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* If you remember, I was one of the few\nwho did not hate The Phantom Menace, in fact, I gave it a positive\nrating. If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels,\nplease be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk\nabout The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots,\nHayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry\ntogether, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest\nof the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden,\nbut I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been\nisolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate\nsurrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more\nabout what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter\nand over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is\nable to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about\nhow Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II.\nThe movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI,\netc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced\nculture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create.\nNow, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I\nthink the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that\ndoesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be\nslow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as\nwell. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through\nCourscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are\nslow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really\nfun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's\nweapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't\ntake that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a\nstick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough\nwith the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good.\nEwan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of\nsophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing\nto seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope.\nJango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is\njust over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden\nChristensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a\nrelate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The\naction is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great\nstart to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The\nfinale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full\nscale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story,\nthought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be\nhonest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and\naction). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I\nwanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started\nreviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!\n"

                "reviews": "\n\nAfter what many perceived to be a weak entry in the prequel trilogy of\nthe star wars movies with regards to TPM. Lucas still 'did his own\nthing' and produced one of the most breathtaking, exhilarating and\nfantastic star wars films to date. In this film we have already\nestablished characters thrust upon the cinema screen once again. The\nopening scroll is simpler than in TPM, it doesn't require us to think,\nit just puts us into the right frame of mind to pick up the story. As\nsoon as we see a ship gliding through the foggy clouds we see straight\naway that something is amiss in the republic. The bright and breezy\nrepublic in the previous film seems to be bathed in fog. Difficult to\nsee the dark side is. Lucas said these are silent movies and the\nvisuals tell their own story and it happens a lot in this film, like\nthe Darth Vader silhouette that had no digital tinkering whatsoever .\nThe footage of Anakin with his robes on was basically a mirror image of\ndarth vader but without the helmet. The footage of Padme next to him\nwas strikingly reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi.\nAbsolutely everything in this movie is intriguing, Obi-Wan Kenobi\ninvestigates a clone facility on the planet of Kamino. A mysterious\nSifo Dyas placed an order for the Clone army based on a template of a\nBounty Hunter called Jango Fett. Jango Fett states he was employed by a\nman called Darth Tryannus. We find a former Jedi, Count Dooku knows all\nabout the corruption in the senate, even if the Jedi arnt yet aware and\nplans to do something about it. Secretly creating a new order with the\ngoal to build an army powerful enough to fight the Republics army. A\nrepublic army which was mysteriously started at the Clone facility even\nthough the Jedi Council were not aware! Confused? No\u0085intrigued? Most\ndefinitely. Anakin Skywalker also gets given a sole mission on his own.\nIts here that the much vaunted love story begins. To be honest, it's a\nbit choppy and seems rushed. Its not a smooth romance like in The\nEmpire Strikes Back, instead it's a romance which reeks of desperation,\nas if the characters themselves know about their impending doom and\nthey just want to be as one before the inevitable happens. The deleted\nscenes on the DVD really should have been implemented within the film.\nThey are gold, with regards to character motivations and shows little\nglimpses of their affection to each other. Would have made the final,\ndeclaration of love scene less jarring. In fact, would have been\ncompletely smooth and believable. The final showpiece in this film is\nthe Clone Wars, they begin on a planet called Geonosis and this is\nwhere the film gives us a scene so wonderful it just keeps on piling\nthe cherry's on top of the cake. A superb full scale war better than\nanything in any star wars movie happens, its absolute mayhem and its\nabsolutely brilliant. But it doesent end there, we have not one\nlightsaber fight, not two, but three. With the third being one of the\nmost memorable of all time. Also, a plot point that culminated in A New\nHope makes its entrance here and it left me absolutely gob smacked\nBasically, this film is everything you would want in a star wars movie.\nIs it the best star wars film out there? Quite possible, difficult to\ncall. Had George Lucas just gone with the flow and put in the\nPadme/Anakin deleted scenes plus toned down the over bearing nature of\nAnakin in the fireplace scene (after reading an earlier draft there's\nsome vocal foreplay at the beginning that would have been great to have\nin the final movie) then this would have been the best Star Wars film\nwithout a doubt. We see intrigue, we see action and we see the galaxy\nbegin to rot away in a very obvious way. The beginning of the end."

We know how you feel, Anakin. Am I the\nonly one who thought this was actually worse than the Phantom Menace? I\ndon't remember anything about the plot of that film but I remember feeling\nmildly entertained. This was just plain boring. From the high-speed chase\nin\nthe city to the weird tall thin aliens to the political assassination\nattempt it all felt like a TV spin-off of the Fifth Element without the\nfamous actors, the beautiful models, the slick direction, the humour, the\ndialogue or the fun. The waterfalls in the background on Naboo looked like\nthe tongue-in-cheek idyllic backdrop on a Kraftwerk CD. The gladiatorial\nscene was straight out of your first Dungeons & Dragons game. The big\nbattle\nat the end was SO BORING people were leaving their seats and returning ten\nminutes later... they'd probably gone outside for a cigarette. The acting\nand the dialogue would, by and large, not have passed muster on a Mexican\nsoap opera; the most interesting part of Natalie Portman's performance was\nthe surprise appearance of her nipples. On the plus side: Yoda drew some\ngenuine laughs with his \"kung fu\" stance, although high-speed Yoda was a\nbit\ntoo fanciful for my liking. Ewan McGregor's effort was good considering\nthe\nmaterial, and his fight with Jango Fett should put him in the running for\na\nrole as 007. But what this franchise really needs to do is bring back\nHarrison Ford... perhaps Han Solo was a clone?\n"

                "reviews": "\nStar Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones is the eagerly anticipated\nsequel to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. After three years\nsince the original let-down, we find out that this one won't include\nJar Jar Binks as a central character, or won't have an irritating ten\nyear old who'll play Anakin Skywalker, we even see a glimpse of what\ncould be everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett! We all reassure\nourselves that Star Wars would get better now, and stay true to that\nclassic style we all cherished. But the same thing with The Phantom\nMenace occurred again, most fans didn't like the movie for reasons\nwe'll explain throughout this review. This movie, like The Phantom\nMenace suffers from a bad script, though not as bad as The Phantom\nMenace's. Firstly the dialog between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin\nSkywalker in the elevator scene at the start of the film. It's a nice\nlittle bit where the two exchange words about their previous adventures\ntogether and show a friendship. Though we as an audience don't know\nwhat they're talking about because we haven't seen those adventures.\nGeorge Lucas can't just simply explain to us that in that one minute\nscene that they're friends, you have to show it in the actual movie,\nlike they did with the Lethal Weapon franchise. Like when Martin Riggs\nreminds Roger about the time he was stuck to a toilet in case a bomb\nwent off in part 2, the two smile remembering that bizarre moment and\nwe as an audience remember it too, relating to the friendship. Here the\nscript takes one short scene in an elevator to tell us that the two are\nfriends because... They were meant to be good friends according to Obi\nWan's story to Luke in Episode IV. Then for the rest of the movie they\ndo there own separate things showing concentration in the wrong area.\nObi Wan's off finding this Clone Army on the planet Kamino and Anakin's\non Naboo protecting Padme from an assassination. Now people criticize\nthe film for Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) acting performance in the\nfilm, but this is a false claim. The actor does very well if the right\nscript is given to him, the bad acting is a result of poor direction by\nGeorge Lucas. For some reason the love story dialog between Padme\nAmidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin is so horrible because... Of the\nway Hayden Christensen says the lines!? Almost every character in this\nmovie has to say stupid lines too, why does all the critique come down\nupon Hayden!? Although Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan makes his lines sound\nmuch better, seeing that he is in fact a better actor. Now another\nreason why everyone dislikes this movie is in fact for the love story,\nthey say it's awkward and forced but we say it's beautiful though very\nclich\u00e9d. There really is no problem with the love story other than it's\nclich\u00e9d as hell, and that great John Williams score doesn't help\neither! But with all the beautiful backdrops and locations, who cares,\nwe think it's perfect how Anakin and Padme fall in love. The movie also\nuses too much CGI, but it makes for some thrilling action scenes, this\nmovie has he best actions scenes out of the whole entire saga. It's got\nthe Bounty Hunter chase through Coruscant, Obi Wan VS Jango Fett, the\nJedi Battlle in that arena, the beginning of the Clone Wars, and Yoda's\nepic light saber duel. Although Yoda having a light saber totally\nclashes with everything he stands for in Episode V, it's still pretty\ncool to see him whipping out and wielding his very own light saber.\nThen Jango Fett, the father of Boba is also a very cool addition to the\nStar Wars Saga, we maybe even prefer him to Boba, just for his awesome\nbattle with Mace Windu on Geonosis. It is also interesting to see\nChancellor Palpatine take his first step into becoming the Emperor in\none of the ending scenes, as he controls the Clone Army. Another great\nthing about the film is Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, back in his old comic\nself again. But another major flaw is the brief relationship between\nAnakin and Owen Lars. At the end of Revenge of the Sith he receives the\nchild of his stepbrother (Anakin) from a guy he didn't even know (Obi\nWan). Anyway, comparing these positives, Attack of the Clones is a\nthrilling space adventure film featuring new awesome planets we love\nlike Kamino and Geonosis. It pushes the action to new heights, and is\nour personal favorite of the saga, making it number one. Though for\nsome reason George Lucas writes Anakin as a bad apple. Anakin is not\nmuch like Luke Skywalker at all, for he is not totally being a good guy\nin this film, this is seen after his mothers death when he mindlessly\nslaughters countless Tusken Raiders. And when he attempts to run at the\nmovies' villain with a light saber with hate and anger! Though there\nare some scenes where he's kind-hearted, most of it is just him being\narrogant, but this doesn't really bother us. Another great thing about\nthe film is Count Dooku, he makes the film very enjoyable but the\nslightly UN-EVEN pacing of the film makes him enter a full hour in!\nEpisode II is an epic story that goes in depth at the look of how the\ndeath of Anakin's mother will influence his fall to the dark side and\nhow his love for Padme will cross a forbidden Jedi rule. The only thing\nwrong with this film, that bugs us enough to point out is the\nrelationship between Obi Wan and Anakin, which should have been\nexpanded. Nonetheless Episode II is the strongest of the saga but\nsuffers from an onslaught of under-ration by fans just because of a few\nreasons they that can't even explain...\n"

The film picks up 10 years later with now Anakin Skywalker\ngrowing up and more yet he's still being trained by Obi-Wan you can see\nthat young Skywalker is stubborn and soon may slip to the evil side of\nthe dark empire as the top Jedi masters can even feel it. However in\nthe current time Anakin has started a romance with Padme who use to be\na former senator and things are more complex when the empire puts out\nan assassination attempt out on her life. The Jedi army then has to\ntake her back to Naboo for her protection. Still in this episode it's\nmore of the same of space fighting and good facing evil as it's a build\nup to a revealing episode III.\n"

In\nLucas's case that is of course the 'Star Wars' series, which seemed to\nbe completed back in 1983 with 'Return of the Jedi,' but being Episode\nVI in a trilogy it seems only natural to assume that some day the first\nthree would be made. But after the final installments of that series\nand Spielberg's 'Indiana Jones' trilogy in the 80s both went on to\ndifferent things and for good reason, but still would talk about them\nwith great fondness. These two love making films and so it's common\nsense that they'd want to not run their franchises into the ground with\nsequel after sequel. But eventually Lucas would return to the series in\n1999 and that proved to be a gigantic success. Three years later the\nstory continued and the stakes got higher for the characters. The\ndarkness found in the later Episodes really starts here, but what of\nthe film itself? "

What I saw\nsome 13 hours ago is the movie of the movies, the movie every true fan and\nevery moviegoer has waited for!\nThis time director George Lucas managed to deliver a fine performance in\ndirecting, storytelling and visualization of the great events that take\nplace in this 2 hours 22 minutes thrill-ride I'd like to call the second\nbest Star Wars movie of all time which means that this is the second best\nmovie of all time (after the original Episode IV - but, hey, I've only\nseen\nit one time until now so things could hint at a No. 1 spot in my personal\nlist!).\nThe movie's atmosphere is far more darker than that of Episode I and I\nthink\nthat Episode II is even darker than Episode V. The galaxy's in a real\nturmoil, because of the separatists that want to leave the Republic. The\nstory has a wonderful pace I'd like to compare with Episode IV. There's\nnot\na single second one feels bored or one feels strange about anything. All\nthe\ndifferent subplots are developed perfectly and find their climax in a\ngigantic battle in the end of the movie.\nThe actors all deliver excellent performances. Especially Hayden\nChristensen's performance marks the perfect portrayal of the later Darth\nVader. You can really feel his inner battle with the dark side. He is a\ngood\nperson with a good heart, but certain things make him turn. In Episode II,\nduring one of the highlights of the movie, Anakin is confronted with his\nfirst dark actions. It will take your breath away, I promise you! Natalie\nPortman and Ewan McGregor do a great job and keep up the fine pace of the\nmovie. McGregor gets to do a lot this time and some of his quotations will\nbe remembered!\nThe hidden star of the movie, now one can deny that, is Yoda. Yes, you\nheard\nit right, Yoda. The Jedi-Master shows the audience why he is the greatest\nJedi of all time and also proves that the advance of digital animation\ncan't\nbe stopped...... The Special Effects are totally exciting, excellent and\nbrilliant, but\nthey never stand above the story, no, they drive the story forward and\nunderline all the aspects of the movie. The CG-characters in this movie\nlook\nso realistic (especially Yoda) that you just won't believe it. Compared\nwith\nSpider-Man (a very good movie, too!) where the animated Spider-Man can be\nrecognized during a lot of scenes as an animation Episode II's\nCG-characters\ninteract perfectly with the real actors. And talking about technical\naspects...... I didn't see any hint that the pictures were entirely shot\ndigitally!\nThe picture looks brilliant, colourful and very rich!\nThe sound effects are superb and John Williams' score perfectly underlines\nthis motion picture experience!\nWhat else to say than well, I already have my tickets for the midnight\npremiere on Wednesday/Thursday and I'll again enjoy a hell of thrill-ride\nwatching this movie that tells us a story of good versus evil from a long\ntime ago in a galaxy far, far away...\nMay the force be with you! Always!\n"

The pacing is extremely\nslow and I have seen better love stories in a minute from the movie Up\nthen what they attempted with Anakin in this. I am extremely dis-tasted\nat the romantic scenes along with the acting throughout the whole\nmovie. Just disappointing that this is branded with the Star Wars name.\nBut I know what you must be thinking, this movie must really be bad and\nI must be incredibly cynical. But let me just say this piece isn't all\nbad. Throughout there are many wonders you can cherish and take with\nyou long after the movie is done. Such as the incredible ending scene\non Geonosis, along with the final lightsaber fight at the end with the\noh so loved Yoda shining through. Including Jango Fett, which is\nanother treat by himself to come from this movie. From the fights on\nKamino to the incredible air scrimmage above Geonosis I am just\nspeechless. The fights in this movie are amazing; the only thing\nbringing this movie down honestly is what they attempted with Anakin. I\ngive it a 7 out of ten for the most everything but the attempted love\nstory. \"Mmm. Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing.\" -\nYoda\n"

Unlike the other films,\nwhich take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII,\nshowing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of \"Wolfenstein\"\nstyle occult mystique and a slight \"Indiana Jones\" sense of adventure,\nthis movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of\nimaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to\nvarious characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the\nfranchise really well.

Despite,\nthe fact that he had a lot of pressure going into this film, I thought\nhe did a fare job. I personally don't think this was the best Avengers\ntie in movie but it was fine. The first half of the movie did a very\ngood job of establishing the story behind the creation of this man and\nhow he was initially just an experiment and then turned into a\npropaganda piece for the war in order to excite people and inspire them\nto fight the fight. Afterward, when he finally does take initiative and\nattempts to infiltrate and destroy the enemy, the movie turns into a\npretty standard and generic action movie. Hugo Weaving is cast as the\nvillain known in the comics as the Red Skull. Despite a good looking\nface (a red face), he never really becomes too menacing and isn't given\nenough screen time as the red skull to really effect us. Tommy Lee\nJones is in his realm as an army commander who is in charge of\noperations including Rogers and is very funny as well as delivering the\nlines extremely well. Speaking of lines, this movie doesn't have the\nbest or worst script and I think they (the writers) could have spent\nmore time developing better dialogue that didn't sound so rushed.\nDirector Joe Johnston who is know for The Rocketeer brings the 1940s\nWorld War feeling to the screen brilliantly and with great set\ndesigners and art direction. Tony Starks father plays a fairly\nsignificant role as the man behind the suit and weapons of the Captain.\nPlayed by Dominic Cooper, we get an inside look at how Stark got his\nattitude and knack for building new technology. The 3D added nothing,\nwhich is not unusual nowadays. The only time it was ever apparent was\nwhen the shield was thrown towards the screen which happened maybe\ntwice. This movie does a nice job of finishing the tie in movie for the\nupcoming epic Avengers movie die to release next year. My only hope is\nthat all of this build up with the individual super hero movies is not\nwasted. This is worth a rental and I will probably buy this on blu-ray\nwhen the price is greatly reduced.\n"

Unlike \"Thor\" and \"Green Lantern,\"\n\"Captain America\" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but\nlarger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero\nstruggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans'\nengaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If\nyou recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing\negotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two \"Fantastic\nFour\" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those\ntwo super heroic sagas. Indeed, \"Captain America\" boasts some amazing\nspecial effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that\nEvans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as\neither a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans\nimparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of\n\"Captain America,\" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us\ngrow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the\nwrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep\nhim down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite\nthe obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain\nwho holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged\nshenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as\nCaptain America's superior and his love interest."

So of course Captain America can lay\nwaste to the Nazis, and if the Red Skull didn't run away at their first\nmeeting (not many as stated in another review) Than the movie would\nhave ended very quickly."

                "reviews": "\nAnother perk of serving our country... an advance screening of a great\nfilm! Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is\ndefinitely a cut above the usual fare. Besides being a tremendously\nsmart and even emotional film, it's also refreshing to see a lead hero\nbe just that... a hero. Steve is no morbid vigilante or narcissistic\nself absorbed anti-hero. He's the real deal. His tough life hasn't made\nhim bitter or jaded. In fact, it's done just the opposite. He's needed\nto develop character because his body didn't develop. This is the key\nto Cap both in the books and in the film. Heart and character trump the\nphysical elements and are what truly makes the character itself\nspecial. Even after he's given the great gift of being a \"super\nsoldier,\" he still continues to do the right thing. It's not to prove\nanything to anyone other than himself because he has a high moral code.\nI love the fact that they choose his character for the experiment\nbecause he wouldn't take advantage of the gift. That's smart writing.\nCap's first assignment from the U.S. government is to be the\ncenterpiece in a traveling USO show, building morale and raising money\nfor the war effort. Eventually, he finds he's wasting his new abilities\nand NEEDS to break away on his own to fight the Nazi menace. This\nbrings him to conflict with the awesomely diabolical Red Skull. The\nSkull is one of Marvel's best crazed villains and they captured that\nperfectly. Here, the Red Skull was a guinea pig for a similar Nazi\nsuper soldier experiment that went very wrong. These clashes and\nconfrontations are everything they should be and more. Shades of gray\nare great in film (and there are those tones present here) but\nsometimes it's good to have character of pure heart, pure integrity and\ntrue morality take it to what history and everyone knows was pure evil.\nIt's refreshing to sit back and root for the ultimate good to take it\nto the ultimate bad guys. It's why I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark and\nit's why I now love this film."

                "reviews": "\nThe First Avenger is finally with us, the superhero that embodies the\nAmerican spirit and what it truly means to be a hero explodes onto the\nbig screen in brilliant colour. The story of ninety pound asthmatic\nweakling Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) who is so desperate to do his bit\nin the war against fascism that he submits himself to Dr Erskine's\n(Stanley Tucci) experiment to create the perfect human. Instantaneously\nRogers becomes a poster boy for the Second World War and puts on about\neighty pounds, he now runs faster and is stronger than any other human\non Earth. But he is not alone in his abilities and he soon finds\nhimself embroiled in the war he was so desperate to be a part in. Can\nthe kid from Brooklyn be the hero his larger than life heart preordains\nhim to be? If you're expecting this movie to be full of gross\nAmericanisms and lots of flying the flag basically the ultimate U.S.\npropaganda spectacle and admittedly there is much that would appease\nthe American sensibility. But this is a story about one man and his\nheart and courage of epic proportions, man with a propensity for good\nand fighting for the good of the common man. This has always been\nMarvel's answer to DC Comics man of steel Superman and by way of\nadaptation alone they have beaten Superman's most recent reboot. Joe\nJohnson has expertly captured that bygone era of periodic Saturday\nmatin\u00e9e serials and when you look at his resume you can see why he was\nchosen to depict the story of one of America's most famous sons."

I wasn't. My kids thought the the\nmovie was fantastic, and I loved it as well, especially since it was\nfree of the cheap raunchiness that afflicts so many movies these days.\nA great storyline, wonderful recreation of the 1940s, honorable\ncharacters, fun humor, nice cast of talented actors. Overall, a truly\nenjoyable film that was both exciting and uplifting, with - finally! -\nsome great moral lessons and some patriotism (that was refreshing in\nthis day and age.)

And this one does not disappoint. We see\nthe story of Steve Rogers, who has been constantly rejected by the\narmy, finally getting the chance he deserves. I have to say, Chris\nEvans's leading performance is rock-solid, and the performances by\nHayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving are no disappointment\neither. The entire film's production is top-notch, ranging from\nexcellent sound design to eye- popping visuals, to a solid film score\nby Alan Silvestri. Some of the action sequences feel a bit too comic\nbook-ish in my opinion though, and at some point you feel like you're\nwatching a trailer rather than an actual movie. But, nonetheless, at\nother times they are brilliantly executed and I have nothing to\ncomplain about. The driving force of this movie is not delivered trough\naction or CGI though, but trough the emotional connection between the\ncharacters, especially the one between Steve and Bucky, his friend.\nAnyway, I won't be spoiling anything, overall it's a very solid,\nhumorous and action-packed superhero movie, and it's one of the best\nMarvel movies to date. It was a pleasant surprise, and is definitely\nworth the ticket.\n"

Avatar is grade A crap. That's right,\nit's crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special\neffects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of\naudiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question:\nIf it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the\ntrees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in\nMatrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about\nthis movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing\nmore than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that\nStar Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough\ncompelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don't\nknow... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has\nNOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly\ndifferentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference\nbetween Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty\nbut it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking\nof, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes.\nThe worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care\nabout the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say\nthat the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is\nthis: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's\nit. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the\naction scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done.\nStill, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge\nlet-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common\nsense.\n"

Avatar is just a sci-fi version of Dancing With\nWolves, and of cause a much worse version of that. The story is weak,\nthe characters are weak, the idea is weak. After 5 minutes you already\nknow what is going on in this stupid movie, and you don't need to be a\nhardcore movie fan to predict the ending of this movie. Other negative\nreviews already mentioned the every detail about why this movie is\noverrated, so it is not necessary to say that again in this review. I\njust want to share my disappointment. Actually what makes me really\ndisappoint is not the movie itself, since there are lousy movie all the\ntime, but the high rating on this movie. IMDb indicates people's favor.\nAnd I think Cameron fooled people once again. He leads movie this great\nart to a lower level not higher. It is so sad. Actually I have to say,\nas a thief (he stolen whole story from other movie), Mr. Cameron used\npeople, wasted people's time, and even worse he made young director\nfrustrated by the Hollywood movie law--high costs equals great movie.\nUnarguably, movie is visual art, it has to be beautiful. So it is\nobviously correct that more technics should be used in movie to make it\nmore visually beautiful. But if the visual beauty is the only thing\nleft in a movie, I have to say, it is not a movie, it becomes a screen\nsaver. So what is the point of a hollow beauty? It is just so sad that\nmost people are cheated by this hollow beauty.\n"

Each animal is obviously based on an earth animal, only they\nhave more legs or extra eyes \u0096 apparently this is what passes for\nimagination these days. And the floating mountains - Miyazaki pulled it\noff years ago in Laputa:Castle in the Sky, in this film they're just\nplain out of place. The love story is predictably obvious and boring.\nAnd hold off on the popcorn as large portions of dialogue about the\nback-story are forced down your throat in the most unintelligent and\nobvious way. As for the culture of the tribe... well it seems to be a\nmix of almost every stereotypical African and South American tribe,\never... rolled into one big ball of naf unbelievable tripe. In short\nthis movie was really a waste of my time and money. And too paraphrase\na review I once heard in relation to another disappointing film in\nrecent years - With a budget $240 million this film really needs to be\neither a cure for cancer, or bloody entertaining; sadly it fails on\nboth fronts. James Cameron \u0096 disappearing for another 12 years would be\na true godsend!\n"

The magnum opus of the master craftsman James\nCameroon delivers magical screen realization to innovative imagination.\nIt took over a decade for the fast-paced technology to catch up to\nbrilliant imaginations of James Cameroon.It is the movie of the decade\nin terms of cinematic imagination (even crossing the earlier standards\nset by LOTR trilogy) and movie of the generation in terms of CG. The\nadvantage of Avatar is that the movie not only revolves around the hype\nof $300 million and IMAX 3D, but has an involving political statement.\nIt brings into light, three major issues. Firstly, the movie itself\nstands as metaphor of the US invasion of Iraq. Secondly it unveils\nimperialism's cold blooded face in disrespecting and demolishing\ncultures. Lastly it has a profound green political statement that\ninsists on bio-diversification. Even though it doesn't indulge itself\ninto individualist philosophies, Avatar is not philosophically void. It\nis illuminated (like the illuminating insects and plants of Pandora) by\nthe philosophy of universal identity believed by the Na'vi tribe. The\nconcept of Eywa really matches with the base theory of coexistence of\nmany human civilizations. Some may say story of Avatar is old wine\n(pointing Dances with wolves, The Last Samurai and all). But, the\ninvasion on aboriginal cultures and human civilizations by imperialist\npowers is repetitive - it happened during civil war, it happens in\nIraq. So the story isn't loosing its relevance but deserves the\nretelling."

When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling is\nallowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killing\nmachine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense of\nlove, however twisted it may be.\n"

It was the\nmost exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the\nwhole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy\nin the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor.\nThis is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any\nof the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many\nhousehold names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those\npeople lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films.\nAll I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on\nthis 5-star, one of a kind classic. Must see, it's too great for a 10\nout of 10 rating. It was way ahead of its time. It's a film of the ages\nand has caliber modern films dream to re-create!\n"

                "reviews": "\nStar wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat\n'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the\nfluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious\nappeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the\nprocess. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects\nthem to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete\nwith nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding\nout in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black\nswamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film\nthat slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master\nwho will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make\nup for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a\nvisually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as\ncool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud\ncity sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious\nheart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues\neverything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of\nDegobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and\ninterplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes\na team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The\ncentrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and\nVader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of\nCinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from\nVader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but\nyou are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of\ndarkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling\nthat the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an\nunderlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is\nnever as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why\nhe is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to\nhis own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new\ncharacters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy\nadministrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation,\nand there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel,\nand an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon.\nAnd of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of\nhis malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of\nthe dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the\ncurious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the\nparts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the\nmost deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature.\nClassic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough\nmemorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema\nhistory.\n"

It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just\ndidn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool\nsuspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's\nbudding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering \"the world is\nnot flat it's round\" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas\nwrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing\nmaniacally and saying \"Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two\nbillion light years!\" or crying with joy all the while with the one\nidea that \"This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the\nend of time and even after that.\" As Hamill said so eloquently, \"In the\nEmpire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has\nproblems, they turned Han into a coffee table!\" I must also include\nSilent Bob's quote \"She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I\nknow'.\" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the\naudience.

Lucas took\nquite a risk with the Star Wars franchise and it (obviously) paid off\nfor him. If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of\nthese documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like\nwhen it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of\nchaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult\nfollowing. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a\ntribute to his true genius and success.\n"

Better than A New Hope, and then some!\nAs for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the\ntheatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the\noriginal version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are\nperfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great\ncharacter in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance\nby Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca,\nand there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the\nAT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of\nthe ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite\nStar Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart,\nhumor, action, drama, suspense.

A wildly ambitious\npicture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over\nthe course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth\nbattle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City,\nbefore finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and\nrevelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some\nseriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few\noutstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or\nunder-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost\nuniversally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han\nand Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise\ntwist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some\nsigns of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those\nmoments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and\nvalleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and\ninstead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort\nthat's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later,\nit's damn near perfect.\n"

                "reviews": "\nLooper is a film that goes to extraordinary lengths to leave every base\ncovered in its quest to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies and in my\nmind it deals with the problems associated with time travel very well.\nOne thing I liked is that the older Joe is aware of everything the\nyounger Joe is about to do which gives him an edge if they were to do\nbattle. I also liked that the older Joe in true Bruce Willis style\nbypasses the whole idea of trying to work out how and why what is\nhappening is happening by saying he can't be bothered to work it all\nout. As well as the older Joe having the advantage of memory over the\nyounger Joe, the younger Joe in turn has his own advantages which\nbecome apparent. There were several times when I thought I'd worked out\nwhat was going to happen or what a particular character's arc was going\nto be but the film cleverly manipulates its audience, leading them down\nalleyways only to jump out at them from behind and spin them around.\nThere is a nice early twist which gave me a smile and plenty more to\nkeep you guessing right the way to the end. In the end it turns out\nthat time travel plays second fiddle to another phenomenon which I was\npleased by as there was no mention of this in the trailer which I've\nbeen trying to avoid for several weeks. The plot is multifaceted with\neach character having their own reasons for being where they are, when\nthey are and doing what they are doing. It is a dense plot which\nexplores several different ideas and concepts both personal and\nscientific."

                "reviews": "\nThis story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the\nbasics of time travel problems and paradoxes. It is a mystery why this\nchaos received so high grades. The plot in short: mafia from the future\nsends their assassination targets into the present to be disposed of;\nin the present there are killers, so called loopers (organized by a\nsadist from the future) who await their targets and kill them. Before\nor later, the looper receives a mission to kill his future self. Some\nof them fail to do so. And then the chase begins. First of all, the\npremise is pretty stupid, to use such advanced technology for such\nmundane goal. In the movie they have explained, that in the future it\nis impossible to get rid of someone without being tracked. It is, as it\nseems, far easier to build a time machine then to avoid tracking\ntechnology from a collapsed society. Then we have a pretty horrifying\n(and illogical) scene of punishment for a failed looper. His present\nself is mutilated and his future self loses his limbs one by one. This\nis wrong, all his wounds have been inflicted in the past so they would\nappear all at once in the future. And it is unresolved if his present\nself has been killed or will they keep him alive for the next few\ndecades without his limbs, until he is sent into the present. Then we\nhave our \u0084hero\", Joe who escapes his captors in the future, escapes his\npresent looper-self and begins his search for a mysterious future mafia\nboss, the elusive \u0084Rainmaker\", who in the future has killed his wife.\nThen begins a \u0084Terminator-rip-off\". Terminator-Joe from the future does\nnot have exact information about Rainmaker, only his date of birth and\nhe manages to narrow his search to only three kids he will have to\nkill. He eliminates two targets and of course, his past self protects\nthe real Rainmaker, the fact that it HAS TO BE KNOWN to his future self\neven before his trip to the past, because it is past, no matter when\nthe audience has find out this. Then the Terminator-Joe eliminates his\nentire (ex-)gang and there is a showdown between him, his present-self\nand the Rainmaker-Kid. The situation is resolved when the present Joe\nkills himself and the Terminator-Joe disappears. Which would set in\nmotion time traveling paradox: Terminator Joe does not exist so he cant\nbe sent into the past and all his actions would be reversed. But no,\nall his actions in the movie remain. The Rainmaker-kid survives and he\nwill grow up not to be mafia boss but exemplary member of future\nsociety. The end. Oh, and this Rainmaker-kid has a Carrie-like\ntelekinetic abilities, which has nothing to do with a plot and is\ncomplete superficial. As for the pacing of the movie, it is horrible.\nWe begin with a bang (literary), then a movie comes to a halt and we\nhave an hour or so pure boredom (or character \u0084development\"). Then we\nhave a final shoot out. All in all a very bad experience, caused by a\nfanboy-hype. If you want to see Bruce Willis travel through time, watch\n\u008412 Monkeys\", a far superior movie in every sense.\n"

Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are cast as one in the\nsame character in this disappointing actioneer that pits them against\neach other with a no-win outcome. Furthermore, both protagonists emerge\nas more anti-heroic than heroic. If you dismiss the fact these talented\nthespians bear scant resemblance to each other, you must still consider\nthe scarcity of information about a distant future as well as a warped\npremise. These shortcomings constitute the chief flaws in this\nimaginative but predictable sci-fi saga that unfolds in an erratic\nmanner, lacks quotable dialogue, and features one character with no\nqualms about shooting innocent adolescents. By the time this\nuninspired, R-rated, 118-minute, spectacle has worn out its welcome;\nyou have no reason to care about anybody, including an obnoxious\ntelekinetic tyke who doesn't know when to keep his trap shut. Mind you,\nthe future has never appeared more dystopian. Some people are born with\na mutation that enables them to levitate objects, and these fellows\nfind that they can lure facile-minded babes into bed by making quarters\nfloat above the palms of their hands. The economy has hit bottom, and\nvagrancy has become epidemic. Citizens can execute vagrants on the spot\nif they feel so inclined. Any time Hollywood undertakes a time travel\ntale, the filmmakers conjure up some of the ugliest vehicles. While the\ncars and trucks look hopelessly tacky, the motorcycles resemble\nsomething Luke Skywalker might ride. Basically, you see a guy\nstraddling a cylinder with handle bars. Computer-generated special\neffects blur everything beneath his feet so he appears to be cruising\non a cushion of air."

The film starts off with a narrative from Joseph (as he\nplays the main character alongside Bruce), and explains what he does\nfor living as he waits to kill this guy from the future. The story then\ngoes on to detail what a Looper is and how when they come to the end of\ntheir usefulness the mob send back their older selves and the younger\nversion to kill himself. So far so good. Just before Bruce (older\nversion of Joseph) gets sent back, it shows you what the mob does to\npeople who let their older selves escape ie they don't kill them. This\nis the start of the movie not making any sense. They capture the\nyounger version and begin to remove his limbs, the older version starts\nto see his limbs disappear (this is quite disturbing and stuck with me\na little). One question, if the younger version has had his limbs\nremoved, how the hell did the older version run in the first place.\nSurely, when he appeared in the first place he wouldn't have any limbs.\nWithout telling you the rest of the story, the film pretty much goes on\nlike this all the way through. It's like they had a script that made\nsense and somewhere along the line it has been altered so much that now\nit mite as well be used for toilet paper. I will be keeping an eye out\nfor this director and be sure not to watch any more films by him. Oh\nyeah, if you do watch it, the end of the film makes no sense at all, I\ncould have put up with minor time paradox mistakes, but the end of the\nfilm just makes me wish I hadn't watched it. Hope this helps.\n"

There is a great\nstory line that suggests looking for comfort and approval betweent\nHart's character and Cube's. There are hilarious comments throughout\nthe film and the writing was quite original. This is a great movie with\nstrength in the plot, the characters and just fun throughout.

While \"Ride Along\" isn't a bad comedy, at its best\nit is just mildly amusing. I think a big reason why it isn't funnier\nthan it is is due to the screenplay being very predictable. Once you\nknow the premise of the movie, you can pretty much predict what is\ngoing to happen some time before it actually does. The screenplay\n(written by FOUR screenwriters!) should have been wilder in both its\nhumor and with the plot. But as I said, there are still some amusing\nmoments here and there. What really does keep the movie afloat are the\nperformances by the two leads, Ice Cube and Kevin Hart. They both give\nvery appealing performances and show that they are up to the challenge\nof whatever the screenplay and direction could throw at them. It's a\npity, though, that they weren't given much material that was more\nbiting in nature.\n"

I don't want to be overly critical here,\nbut he was not that funny. Just like in his other movies in which he's\nnot the star, he was continually running his mouth and being a pest. I\nsee that that's his niche: talking A LOT and being pesky. It got tired\nreally fast. How annoying can one person be?

We\nall know by now to expect poor, wooden acting from Cube but other major\nlet-downs also came in the form of John Leguizamo and Laurence\nFishburn. Set in Atlanta focusing on the strained relationship between\nhardened street cop James (Cube) and his proposed\nbrother-in-law/wannabe cop Ben (Hart), the former takes the latter on a\n24 hour ride along around the city to test his prowess as a law\nenforcement officer and his suitability to marry his beloved sister.\nThe story is tried and tested failing to break any new barriers or set\nthe world alight with the on-screen chemistry between the two main male\nroles often seeming tedious and slow to develop. Hart however keeps at\nit, plugging away with it in his own unique way which goes some way to\nsalvaging the film. What begins tedious ends pretty well as the film\ngets better as you get into it. Hart is the saving grace making this\nmovie entertaining and worth the watch but there is also a good\nsupporting effort from Tika Sumpter playing Hart's/Cube's sister.\nWithout Hart this movie would be a huge flop as it is far from perfect\nyet entertaining and somewhat funny eventually earning its 6/10.\n"

                "reviews": "\nThis buddy cop movie directed by Tim Story, was surprising very funny!\nThe film is about Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) a fast-talking, security\nguard whom has dreams of joining the Atlanta Police Department and\nmarrying his girlfriend, Angela (Tika Sumpter). Tika Sumpter is one\nattractive woman, I have to say. For him to marry her and get a good\nwork in with the Police Department, he has to join his potential\nbrother-in-law James Payton (Ice Cube), an APD cop/detective, on a\n24-hour patrol of Atlanta in order to prove himself worthy of marrying\nAngela. What Ben doesn't know, is that, James is on the hunt for the\nmost ferocious kingpin in the city name Omar. Omar is so terrifying and\nimposing that no one has ever seen his face. I wouldn't spoil it, but\nyou can pretty much, guess who it is, by the opening credits. It's not\nthat hard. It did indeed kinda ruin a lot of the film, for me. I have\nto say, 2014, looks like it's going to be comedian Kevin Hart's year.\nKevin Hart's performance itself is arguably worth the price of\nadmission. I never did like a lot of Kevin Hart's previous films, so I\nwas pretty happy with the results here. He has this charm to his\ncharacter in the film that you can't help not hate. While, Ben Barber\ndoes has his clumsy shtick, it was never as offended as a Jar Jar Binks\npest type of a black stock character. While, he is normally failing in\nattempting to prove himself capable, Ben does invoke some knowledge\nuseful in the case through his knowledge of weapons which he learn in\nvideo games. He was indeed very helpful in the movie. His facial\nexpressions are just funny to watch whenever he is fact with real\ndanger. I didn't find Kevin Hart one bit as annoying as Chris Tucker in\nother buddy cop films. The way, he acts throughout the film from being\na charisma klutz to a tough guy role is hilarious to watch. Reminds me\nof a bit of Eddie Murphy mix with Martin Lawrence. Great comical\ntiming. Ice Cube is pretty much old school Ice Cube in this movie\nplaying a tough, loose cannon cop. I wish there was more character\ndevelopment for him. He was indeed cold and cool. Still, I can't see\nhim as an action star or a real cop. This movie is about Ice Cube\nshowing Kevin some Hart, so you know, predictable that the buddy cop\nstory was going to have a good ending. The opening to the movie was\nvery cheesy with over the top action buddy cop clich\u00e9s like the angry\nsuperior officer and rogue action, no back up cop. In the middle and\nthe end of the film, the humor got more realistic, and the events that\nhappen wasn't off the wall, dumb. While this basic plot line has indeed\nbeen done to death, it mocks previous buddy cops movies by using\nprevious popular movies lines such as 2001's Training Day to 1982's 48\nHrs. The movie does too much talking with few action scenes, but it\ndoes work, most of the time. The Jokes are so prolonged, it takes\nforever to get to the punch line. I was pretty surprise, the film was\npretty tame with the language, surprising since both Ice Cube and Kevin\nHart curse a lot. The 'N' word is rarely used here, and I'm pretty glad\nit wasn't use much in the movie. Plus, most of the jokes here are\ncommon jokes that you might see in any buddy cop movie. There is little\nracism black jokes. There isn't a lot of sexual jokes. Both are rare\nnot to see in African American comedies these days. I have to give the\nmovie props for thinking outside the box. On the other hand, the script\nlends itself to other flaws like odd filler scenes and backstabbing\ntwist, you can tell was coming. The odd double cross was much a\nlet-down, that I wish it didn't happen. Sadly, I have to blame\nmarketing as I have already seen most of the funniest bits in the\ntrailer and coming in. It wasn't as funny as the first time. I wouldn't\nsay this is the funniest film ever, but I have to say, it's the\nfunniest buddy cop movie in a long while. Don't expect anything new,\nRide Along stand out amongst the many buddy cop films made. It could've\nbeen a lot better. Still, it was a pretty good movie.\n"

I\ncame on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I'd\nreconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my\ninitial assessment. Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this\nmovie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight\nscenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current\nIMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I\nrated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her\nhaving a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of\nNatalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're\ninto comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a\nyoung kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is\nkilling people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad\nreview because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see\nsomething that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not\ngoing to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here\nand complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It's clearly\ngeared at a older teen/young adult audience and is rated R, what did\nyou expect. In closing, one of the most entertaining films I've ever\nseen.\n"

I had to stop the movie several times, thinking why i'm\nstill watching this? DAMM WATCHMEN was violent too, but it gave a hard\natmosphere and background. It shows how to make a 'real life'\nsuperheroes thing. Kick-ass, in it's colour dandy world, only shows how\nit is cool to kill people with cool moves, and dropping blood on the\nscreen is cool too.

That is so ridiculous to\nthink that when in today's society, there are children watching porn or\nplaying bloody video games. I think there is no problem with this film,\nI mean do people remember \"The Exorcist\" where you see a girl\nmasturbating with a crucifix and people said it was an amazing movie,\nor \"The Professional\" where you see a girl join with an assassin that\nblows people's brains. People who think so negatively about this film,\nare super narrow minded idiots with no sense of humor. If you like\nmartial arts, gunfire, superheroes, dark humor and stylized action,\nthis is the movie for you, but if you only watch movies for character\ndevelopment, tone, art direction, script or other poetically beautiful\ncrap like that and also if you are easily offended by almost anything,\nthis movie is just not for you. I personally give it a 10/10.This movie\nis original, random, different and in the end, it has heart. If you're\na parent that talks profane language at front of your children and let\nthem play video games like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto , your kids\nare gonna love this movie.\n"

Every single comic reader ever has considered\ndonning a mask a cape and becoming a superhero. Kick-Ass addresses that\nand it's exactly what the main character Dave Lizewski does. He becomes\nan amateur superhero named KICK-ASS! So he goes out a couple of nights\na week and fights crime. The movies average at this point and not\nreally exciting, but certainly not boring. Then just before Kick-Ass is\nabout to get beaten up Hit Girl arrives and massacres a load of guys,\nto the banana splits theme, with 2 samurai swords, whilst dressed as a\nsuperhero, at the age of 11! Before I saw this movie I thought that the\nmost awesome movie character ever was The Comedian from Watchmen. Hit\nGirl makes The Comedian look like Scooby Doo, she's vulgar, she's\ndeadly, she's totally bad ass and she's an 11 year old girl! But she's\nnot on her own, Nicholas Cage himself plays her Batman like father\nwho's secret superhero identity is Big Daddy. Big Daddy is obviously\nbased on Batman, but he's a thousand times better."

So, in actual fact, it's more adult than\nchildish although I was only 13 when i first saw it and i thoroughly\nenjoyed it as did my 42 year-old dad who is very critical about most\nfilms so this really says something. As for the foul-mouthed 12-year\nold, do not be put off by this as this may not be entertaining but this\nmakes the film what it is and you kind of just have to ignore the use\nof the C-word in one of the scenes. Even though this film is classed as\ncomedy, it is very dark and even made me cry at one point. The intense\nblend of action with background music is amazing. This film has the\ncoolest fight scenes i have EVER seen. Anyone in the right mind would\nwant to see this, i recently got it on blu-ray and it astonished me how\ngood the quality was so i definitely recommended it.\n"

It went from a\nkid simply trying to correct the wrongs of society to a group of heroes\nkilling people to avenge the death of Nick's wife. It was funny at\nparts, sad at others, and funny/sad at the same time (not in a good\nway.) There were a few parts where I felt awkward just sitting there.\nWas this part funny? Do I feel bad for laughing? It honestly felt like\ntwo different writers got together without talking about what each\nperson was writing and made a film. First guy said, \"heroic teenager\nredeems the good qualities of society.\" Second guy said, \"murderous\npreteen girl avenges her mothers death by killing cocaine kingpins.\"\nThird guy in the corner, \"How in the world can we tie those together?!\"\nGOOD THINKING THIRD GUY.\n"

'Diablo (2015)' is a\nwestern.. to some might be boring but no matter what, it too still\nsurvives and probably surpasses most movies today.. great choice to put\nScott Eastwood as the main role.. one sees similar aspects as when his\ndad Clint Eastwood played western characters.. it is great to pass on\nthose characteristics just like a family inherited tree.. love that\nthey choose Alberta, Canada.. it is a majestic magical place to film\nany western.. such like the ever so popular and also is a great western\nof types CBC's Heartland.. look The Revenant starring Leonardo DiCaprio\nwas filmed in Alberta too and look what awards came to be\nsurprisingly.. Leonardo DiCaprio should be in more western style\nmovies.. think he would make a great present day cowboy.. so you see\n'Diablo (2015)' and any western out there will always be a great movie\nto watch no matter what all the other critics downplay about these\nmovies.. to know what a western is, is to live where the heart of\nwestern society exists.. otherwise you wont understand what the script\nwriters and producers were thinking when they made these films that\ncame to be.. put yourself in the shoes of these western character roles\nand i bet you will feel like a cowboy/cowgirl too.. you will see first\nhand that westerns will always be a part of past and future history...\n--- movie review by elektrikradiance\n(http://elektrikradiance.promodj.com) - Alberta, Canada...\n"

A good loop.\nWithout spoiling it for audiences Diablo is nothing like what you\nexpect from a Western and is everything that you ever wanted from one.\nAt the Q and A the director talked about consciously avoiding western\nclich\u00e9s and trying to be authentic whenever he could. The result is\nvisually stunning. Director of Photography Dean Cundey (Apollo 13,\nJurassic Park, Back to the Future) lensed the film. and the\ncinematography is epic. Their use of unique looking aerials to capture\nthe American landscape really helps tell the story and captures the\nworld of the mentally tortured PTSD Jackson (Eastwood's character)\nincredibly well. The movie starts out rather quickly with a big action\nscene and moves from there. Danny Glover makes an appearance here and\ndoesn't disappoint (although I still would have loved to see more of\nhim). But what lacks in Danny's screen time is made up by the always\nimpressive Walton Goggins as the evil highway man Ezra. He reaches deep\nand pulls off a chilling performance reminiscent of some of the most\nevil protagonists from the genre. In contrast to him a young but\ntalented Scott Eastwood rounds out the cast and delivers a capably deft\nperformance chillingly similar to you know who... Diablo delivers a\nsuccessful punch but beware it will be unlike any western you've seen\nbefore. Depending on your taste it could go either way. I myself\nenjoyed it and recommend it.\n"

The writer Carlos Del Rios is\nspot on, and has insights into a time when the glamor of the West was\nhighlighted and sensationalized.

Even the fights, are displayed in such a\nway that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like\nscreaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the\nperformances of the cast, that is surprisingly good.

Despite this, Gladiator\nis one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes\nso smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score.\nDirector Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he\ndoes just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure\ndo) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down\nwas also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood\nand gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent\nperformance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley\nScott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal\nbattles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real\nlife centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor\nCommodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits\nin attempts to get his revenge against Maximus."

Film pictures all\nthe gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side\nof the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that\nthe gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably,\nwere hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we\nsee here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only\nwoman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's\nsake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time.\nSeems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The\nMikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo\n\"But darling, you forget: in Japan...\" except that in the latter case WS\nGilbert meant it as a joke.

He is also, once again, what stands as a\ntrue definition of a man. A man has to be responsible and patient, and\nthis man just does that. If I have to pick a single most influential\nperson besides Jesus, I'd still go with Maximus. What he did in the\nmovie was truly outstanding and I wish that he was an actual person in\nhistory. The death of his family gave him a small moment of despair,\nbut he took it all in, including the loss of his rank and his status\nnow as a \"slave.\" As Maximus gradually progresses as a gladiator in the\nmovie, he just becomes more and more bad ass, being the true hero of\nthe entire movie. He never flinches in pain, but stands up, all the way\nto the end. The faithfulness he builds in his two friends is\nawe-inspiring, and their willing to take consequences for his survival\nis what represents strong friendship. Maximus is by heart THE man.\nGladiator is one of the most inspirational movies I saw, and there are\nno others like it."

I have really loved the\nCraig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond\nmovie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the\nsame feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient\nand with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel\nof a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next\none. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This\nhad possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could\ngo on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will\nlove this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a\nfan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this\na very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to\nwatch this one again as soon as the movie was over.

Some might still be put off by\nDaniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a\nfew good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier\nBardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant\nbut eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory\nand as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual\nas M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This\nis not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more\nemotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get\nsome relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something\nhappens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest\nof the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond\ntrademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might\nnot like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny\nand very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original\nperformance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a\ncompletely different character which I think is the only right thing to\ndo. This is not only a great Bond movie but just a downright great\nfilm.\n"

There is nothing in this movie what is expected\nfrom a bond movie. No new gadgets, No story ( List of agents for a bond\nmovie and what happened to that list after half way through the movie?)\n. The climax ( I was thinking am I watching a bond movie or in a wrong\ncinema ) feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money\nfor the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down\nScottish house. With the home made defenses and geriatric defenders.\nThis movie may be numerically a box office success but leaves behind a\n50 years legacy in shreds. This is by far the absolute worst Bond movie\nI have ever seen. There is no plot, there are no emotions to be invoked\nin the viewer (I couldn't feel for any of the characters, not even when\nM died in the end), there is no main theme - everything just seems to\nbe randomly put together I really wonder how could critic give any\nrating to this movie. Total waste of Time\n"

This was the first Bond movie I've seen at\nthe Cinema since Thunderball (yes that years ago) i usually watch\nmovies on DVD/bluray but felt because of all the hype that Skyfall\nwould be worth going to see.

                "reviews": "\nI do love James Bond movies. As soon as the movie was released in\nSpain, I wanted to watch it. So, yesterday, after a light dinner with a\nfriend, I went to the cinema. At first, I was extremely comfortable\nwith the movie. A list of secret agents has fallen into the wrong\nhands, and Bond has to recover the list whatever the cost. M has her\nhead on the line, so, she becomes ruthless and drives her agents into a\ncoldblooded rampage of killing and destruction in order to get back the\nstolen list, including a very uncompassionate approach to her own\nagents if she believes they stand on the way to the mission's success.\nAll starts with some scenes packed of good action in Turkey, where two\nMI6 agents pursue the bad guy, one of these agents being Bond. Finally,\nafter a good chasing and some fights on top of a train, Bond is shot\naccidentally by the other agent (a pretty black woman) on M\ninstructions, and Bond is considered missing in action, supposedly\ndead. Of Course, Bond is not dead, returns to duty after some colourful\nand self-destructive holydays in South America, where he drinks tequila\nshots with a scorpion on his hand(very nice scene), and is unleashed\nagainst the bad guys again, going to Shanghai to capture the mysterious\nbad guy who previously eluded capture in Turkey. We have some very good\nscenes of a shooting in a Chinese skyscraper, the appearance of a very\nbeautiful Asian woman, a Macau prostitute, and some interesting moments\nin a strikingly beautiful and decadent Chinese casino with an arena\nfull of Komodo Dragons and bad guys, which is great\u00a1\u00a1. Then, Bond sets\nsail with the beautiful Asian woman in a magnificent sailing yacht, and\nreaches an abandoned island where the bad guy (Javier Bardem) lives.\nThe good part of the movie ends here. From now on, all loses\ncredibility, does not stand scrutiny, and all is utterly ridiculous. A\nsensation of boredom invaded me and the rest of the audience. We do not\nhear any more about the list of agents, or any other tangible or\nmeaningful plot. A bad guy with mommy issues for M, who feels betrayed\nby her just appears out of the blue, and all he wants is personal\nrevenge. A bad guy with mommy issues is just unfit for a James Bond\nmovie. We wanted to see a bad guy full of plans to control or destroy\nthe world, with some intelligent design that Bond will try to thwart\ndesperately in the last minute. However, we are just given a poor chap\nwho calls M \"Mom\" (I nearly jumped from my seat and puked when I heard\nthis\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1), suffers from Oedipus complex and feels betrayed, engaging in\na sort of vengeful killing spree. From this moment the movie rapidly\ndecays into unbearable nonsense, and feels almost like an insult. The\nend is just so bad\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 Basically Bond takes mommy (see M) to his\nancestral home in Scotland in order to kill the bad guy with old\nhunting rifles. The Bad guy arrives with a bunch of thugs and a\nhelicopter, torches the house, and then Bond kills the bad guy with a\nknife without fighting, M dies, and the movie ends. In order to\ncompensate the very poor script and ending, a new M and a new Money\nPenny are given to us, setting the atmosphere for the next movie.\nCasino Royale was very good. Quantum of Solace was not so good. Skyfall\nis very bad. The decreasing quality of this franchise is evident. It\ndoes not work anymore and a new formula is desperately needed. The only\ngood point is that we have got possibilities of a new and fresh start\nfor the series; we have a new Money Penny (The Pretty Black Woman who\naccidentally shot Bond), and a new M (Ralph Fiennes, who could make a\ngood M). So, I hope they make something sensible and good next time.\nThis movie was the end of a cycle for the Daniel Craig-Judi Dench\nfranchise. A new approach and new ideas must be developed, and we all\nwant back the true James Bond, and not the big BS they gave us this\ntime.\n"

To me, it was a\nsimple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen.\nHowever, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now\nwhat happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word\nof any horror topics beforehand in the script.

All of this can-\nand *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a\nloving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those\nmovies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is\nastounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by\nJuliette\nLewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than\nhold\nher own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and\nSalma\nHayek in a bikini. What's not to like?     \n"

My peers always try their best to defend it,\nprobably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but\nthey'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's\nsome huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie\nto vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever.\nSuddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is\nlike sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding\nit with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it. C:\nPreposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars,\nbrothers with the last name \"Gecko,\" bad vampire make-up jobs, Cheech\nMarin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only\nfires when \"erect\" and belongs to a guy who goes by \"Sex Machine.\" If\nRobert Rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his\nviolence, I might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. The whole\nproject's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. The\nonly thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is George\nClooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his\nblood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother. I swear I\nthink they thought it up right then and there. This movie's out to\noffend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible\nmovie.\n"

From\nDusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story\nof the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino.\n They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally\nalready by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a\ngas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their\nRV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little\nmoral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his\nwit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the\nacting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the\nwhole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a\nstrip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here,\nto the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a\ndegree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might\nhave had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once\nagain shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very\ngood in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred\nWilliamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film. \n\n"

Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and\nthe film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer\nunpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of\nthe narrative. A similar trick is employed in \"From Dusk Till Dawn\"\n(although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film\nis a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin\nTarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well\ndelineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches\nto become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a\nhyperactive homage to \"Night Of The Living Dead\"! It is a jarring\nswitch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There\nis an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never\ngets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is\nnot introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably\nwell-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with\ntheir outrageous roles."

                "reviews": "\n\n\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is a great crossover between A- and B-movies, that\nonly a genius like Quentin Tarantino could have made possible: there are\ngreat character actors (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis) next to Hollywood\nsuperstars like George Clooney, Salma Hayek or Tarantino himself. Not to\nforget the excavation of almost forgotten cult-,trash- and C-movie actors\nlike Cheech Marin, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, John Saxon or Michael Parks.\nOf course, \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is also the only serious horror film of the\n90s, which gave this sickening genre some new impulses. While all those\nteenager flicks like \"The Faculty\" (also directed by Robert Rodriguez) were\nonly rip-offs from their elder examples, FDTD has enough originality to be a\nreal classic! This movie is full of slime and gore, absurd ideas (holy water\nfilled in condoms), although the showdown reminded me a little bit on Peter\nJackson\u00b4s \"Braindead\". Instead you get a great performance from Salma Hayek,\nwho is one of the most erotic women alive! Her dance is one of the most\nunforgettable moments ever featured in a horror film! Many people also find\nit idiotic to combine a gangster story with a splatter flick: well, you\nshouldn\u00b4t take this movie too serious, because \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is\nnothing else but a B-movie with A-list actors. It exists from his crazy\nideas and the pure fun entertainment! (9/10)\n"

I had a feeling that\nsomething was going to change when one of the characters in the strip bar\nthreatened another character with a knife, only to be confronted with a gun\nthat swivelled into place from a device attached around this man\u00b4s groin\narea. It was an incongrous moment and just didn\u00b4t fit in with the previous\ntempo of the movie as a whole. And, of course, we then had an infamous\nvampire orgy of blood and violence that equated the bloodletting in\nPeckinpah\u00b4s THE WILD BUNCH. I say equated but not bettered, for Peckinpah\u00b4s\nepic was stylish and exhuberant. Here it was way over the top and virtually\nportrayed as fun. But then again, looking at the movie as a whole, perhaps\nbeing way over the top was the point, paying homage not only to Hollywood\nbut world cinema in general along the way. The Tarantino script tips it\u00b4s\nhat to the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa\u00b4s"

It was like a time warp back to Dogs/Pulp, but\nwith Clooney in the mix. Tarantino's acting was once again painful\nhowever - it's bearable in Dogs/Pulp because it's kept to a minimum.\nBut I can't stand his voice, delivery and chin. Clooney was great,\nalthough after a while his \"lines\" became a bit much. It was starting\nto feel like a profane trailer instead of a movie. I don't know if the\nsubtlety needed to come from Clooney toning it down a little, or\nTarantino writing something less corny. This would have been a keeper\nfor me if Tarantino replaced himself with someone from his regular\ngroup like Buscemi, then chose to direct, and sh#tcanned the whole\nvampire bit. I'm not into vampire movies so I had no use for the last\n50 minutes. Vampire fans will like this more than Dogs/Pulp fans.\nOverall, a bummer.

There are other movies which\nare violent, like Cross of Iron, the Wild Bunch, Saving Private Ryan,\nPsycho or Letters from Iwo Jima. I liked these movies because each of\nthese movies have something else to offer besides violence. Sure there\nis a weak effort to make some fun like in the living dead series. Sure\na tongue in cheek effort is made to hint at the vampire genre. Sure\nthere is the sexy dancing. But it lacks the fun, it lacks the twist and\nabout the sex:after Selma Hayek has done her stimulating dance she is\ngone in a minute because what is left is violence: pure, undiluted,\nutter, gory, bloody, sexy violence.

Indeed, Harvey Keitel, naturally, but also George Clooney,\nand Tarantino himself continue to pronounce their well-chosen lines with\nexactly the right emphasis and all seems set for more interesting plot\nturns. However, being completely unprepared for Mexicans rising from the\ndead and turning into monsters, I found myself gazing stupefied at what\nfollowed.(The presence of Juliette Lewis might have warned me that\nsomething\nweird was coming, but since the Tarantino character seemed the central\npsycho of the story, I didn't expect inhumans in any literal way). How\ncould\nhe and Rodriguez have thrown their fine ingredients into this maladorous\nboiling pot of illogical nonsense? Now that I learn that this was his\nfirst\nscript, I hope for a return to the older, or rather later developed style.\nAll in all, as a horror comedy the movie has its moments and it is worth\nseeing, but I think it could have been so much better if the story line of\nthe first part would have been followed to the end.\n"

The film has been hyped for months via\nviral marketing, JJ Abrams fan boys, and media coverage/ monster\nspeculation. Did it live up to the hype? The answer is OH GOD YES\nCloverfield is by far the most intense monster film I have ever seen in\nmy lifetime, after the initial 15 minutes of character introduction and\nwhatnot the film does not go 5 minutes without a HOLY CRAP moment.\nConstantly driving you to the edge of your seat at every turn and it\nreally pulls no punches, I was surprised to learn it was rated PG13.\nNow the film is entirely filmed in shaky cam since you cant really\nsurvive a monster attack pushing a trolley around and it just works,\nyou may get motion sickness though so be warned. The camera itself\nbecomes a character of the film as it IS the viewer making everything\nhappening on-screen more and more realistic. Now the acting is amateur\nbut thats for the best considering that the film would have made no\nsense if they had used big name actors/actresses, the characters are\nnot that deep either and mostly serve as fodder, comic relief, moral\nguidance, panic, commentary, puzzlement, a little bit of annoyance, in\nother words they're people surviving a monster attack. The presentation\nis brilliant, the only music heard is in the party and at the ending\ncredits and the special effects are some of the most seamless stuff\nyou'll ever see in a film. The monster itself is actually not seen in\nits entirety only being viewed from different angles for the audience\nto piece it together as the survivors themselves are, you pretty much\nknow as much as they do about everything going on making you actually\nfeel like you're there. Critics compare the film to Blair Witch meets\nGodzilla but it is so much more than that, Cloverfield is the\ndefinitive American Monster Film, best if seen on the opening weekend\njust to hear the audience's reactions not to mention the presentation\nis far greater on the big screen, watch it again to see the things you\nmissed or just to enjoy the ride again, admittedly the shock value will\nwane with multiple viewings but for what it's worth Cloverfield is an\nexcellent piece of film and special effect engineering and is the first\ngreat monster film of the millennium. Its also downright scary at\nparts. 8/10\n"

First, it take almost 25 minutes before this movie even\nstarts to get interesting, and after all of the useless banter of party\nguests and drunken camera wedding style say \"hi\" to Rob before he goes\nto Japan B.S., things start to happen, but slowly. And let me tell you\nthat they could have just use the footage from the trailer and skip\nabout 20 of the most boring minutes of the whole film. That feeling of\ninitial excitement is short lived. As you keep watching nothing happens\nthat keeps your interest. Second, the monster, you get little glimpses\nof it until about 60-70 minutes into the film, and you get a very big\ndisappointment, it's not Godzilla, a T-Rex, or anything that is even\nremotely familiar, fun or scary. It looks like someone put the body\nparts in the wrong places. And it's offspring, there are only three\nspots in the film that they are even used, as if an after thought. They\nare used to make two extremely boring parts of the movie more exciting,\nand it fails miserably. Obviously used to make a short film a tad bit\nlonger. They even look like they where stolen them from Starship\nTroopers. Both monster and offspring are so underdeveloped, that they\njust don't work together. If JJ Abrams brought anything back from\nJapan, it wasn't how to make a monster movie. I'll tell you this, the\nJapanese are laughing at us all over again! There will be no\nCloverfield monster for sale at every little store like all the\nGodzilla's all over Japan. JJ, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez\ncalled! They want their cameras back, they want to start filming Blair\nWitch 3! In short, I know, too late, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS\nFILM! The best part of the movie was the ride home.\n"

Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere,\ndestroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of\ncommitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous\nintro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense,\nno explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is\nsaved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's\nintentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of\ninspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty\nfoot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders \u0096 contact with which will\nmake you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One\ndoes wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big\ncities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling\nimagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison\nfor decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images\nare opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as\nrather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11\nporn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live',\nshaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level\nof hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any\ninexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get\nsteadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing\nduring these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch\nrip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you\nsimply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt\ninsulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just\nsheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs.\n"

The crowd is excited to because\nthey to noticed a great looking movie trailer. And then, after a\n#$#$load commercials the movie begins.... \"At least you think\". Because\nfrom the moment the \"movie\" starts your brain keeps wondering when is\nit really going to start. And then half an hour later the pure (visual)\nhorror takes hold of you .. My GOD ... does the camera guy have some\ntremor disease ?! If something exciting happens I want to get a sharp\nview so I can start making up thoughts in my head. Thanks to the\nscrewed up capturing I couldn't help but get very very upset ! The\nBlair Witch project didn't demand that much visual observation as it\nmainly took place in a forest at night and night vision helped out much\nof the time and thus didn't demand much sharp observing from the\naudience. And some folks (dare) talk about motion sickness being a\nshameful thing when watching this movie.. Well watching this movie is (\nI think) even worse when compared with getting aboard a chopper and\nreceiving the Rookie treatment which ends up with you throwing up your\nbreakfast, thanks to the unexpected tricks the seasoned pilot plays on\nyou, with the help of his controls. I just cannot believe people dare\nsay things as \"fantastic\", \"super original\", \"haven't seen such a\ncreative movie in a while\" .. It really makes me wonder did these same\npeople that say such things, live In Afghanistan during the(movies not\nallowed)Taliban regime ?! 1:13 minutes I tried to get a sharp view of\nwhat was going on. Not a moment did I think wow what a \"creativity\" at\nwork here.. So no Mr director you did not succeed in creating a 9/11\ndrama-like emotional, many different camera footage shots, roller\ncoaster ride that was served that specific day in 2001. (Remember those\ncamera close-ups of people running and crying while the camera men kept\nwalking away as the dust clouds came closer and closer. So If someone\nin the future asks me: come up with one original movie you watched the\npast couple of years I won't even think about Cloverfield. To be honest\nI found Godzilla trashing New York a breeze of fresh air compared to\nthis totally screwed up attempt at being \"original\". Last but not\nleast: One thing that really irritated me was the guy behind the\ncamera. Damn your screaming made me want to ask for a refund cause it\nhurt my eardrums big time !!"

An intellectually-untaxing revenge\nplot, a reboot of a classic 80s TV show from my childhood, and, to cap\nit all off, a fine actor in the lead part. However, it was something of\na let-down in the end. Denzel Washington was fine, and Chlo\u00eb Grace\nMoretz did well for such a young actress. But the script and the\nwriting were simply horrible and gave them too few good scenes to work\nwith, and some ridiculous choices to portray plausibly."

It takes ages to get going and I'm\ngetting a bit fed up with these directors casting Eastern Europeans as\ngangsters. On top of that, I found the movie predictable and the\ncharacters weren't that interesting. I did stick with the 2 hour film\nbecause I wanted to see the big showdown at the end, which was average,\nand I still was hoping for something amazing to happen, which it\ndidn't. Denzel Washington just seemed to be in a mood all the way\nthrough the movie, except for when he was doing his Pips shuffle, and\nthe action scenes were average. The girl that caused Denzel to switch\nto a murdering assassin goes missing for most of the movie, which was a\nbit weird, and you don't really find out much about his past which\nwould have drawn you to his character. Anyway, its a watchable movie,\njust because of Washington's performance, but it wasn't that great.\nAverage!"

Some of the reasons why this is bad include every time the\nSouth African duo Die Antwoord was on screen, I had never heard of them\nbefore and never hope to hear of them again as I found their acting to\nbe woeful, probably the worst I've bore witness too, the story being\nborderline ridiculous at times, the dialog was at times hard to\nunderstand and the whole gangsta talk really isn't my cup of tea in\nthis sort of movie and hopefully last but not least, Dev Patel as a\nleading man. Patel, in my opinion, could improve as an actor after\ngetting his lucky break in Slumdog Millionaire as it is now two below\npar roles in the one year, after the Second Best Marigold Hotel and is\nin definite need of improvement. One of the only positives I can glean\nfrom this mess of a movie is Hugh Jackman's performance as he tries his\nbest in a villainous type role which I don't think I have seen from him\nbefore. Anyway, all involved must, and should be shaking their heads\nfuriously at what they had done. This is the first Neill Blomkamp film\nI have watched and I will go back and watch his other two but if he\nkeeps making movies like Chappie, his career will be over before it\nbegins. The one thing they should have had in this movie is an amnesia\nray, like in Men In Black, so I could use it to erase this film from my\nmind.\n"

The only confusing part is they\nare run by human mind but he still has to sit in this chair and have\nthis giant joystick to control his robots. If they lest the stupidity\nof the Gangsters and left it to Vincent Moore and his robot vs Deon\nWilson and his robot army and Chappie this movie would be one of the\nbest of all time. Yo-landi is just creepy and can't act period, Ninja\njust can't act and looks like an idiot through the whole movie. They\nmake Ninja look smart by how he controls Chappie but at other times\nthey make him look idiotic which again is illogical. Then Hippo is just\nan angry meathead. I don't see anything good coming from these three\ncharacters and their posse in the whole movie.\n"

I must be missing\nsomething to be so at odds with the majority here. Why the level of\ncelebrity was utilized in such a shockingly bad venture must certainly\nhave been done for the respect they had with a ranking executive,\nsimply for the paycheck or a favor they owed the producer/director for\na past job they've been chosen for. If not, I have no idea why they\nchose this script/project. Chappie isn't a film that a majority of\nparents would allow for very young audience due to violence, language\nand it's visual reference to language throughout. It's somewhat limited\nto an older teen to twenty something audience and this might be why I\ndidn't find it worth the two hours I watched it. Though it does have\nsome comedic value, it's not a comedic film. I have become ever more\ninterested in Sci Fi and this tag might have been what pulled me in.\nThe genre is certainly enjoying a high point lately continuing on the\nlarge screen as well as extremely good programming on the small screen.\n"

It's not bad adding some explosions, except\nthe major conflict of the plot bogs down its potential, turning it into\na generic action film and also has a dumb climax with an ending that\nhardly makes sense.

I knew that most of the so called professional critics weren't\neven going to see the movie and would trash it based solely on Adam\nSandler and Kevin James. I don't blindly hate Adam Sandler like most of\nthe drones nowadays. Sure he had horrible movies in the past few years\nlike Jack and Jill, the Grown Ups movies, and Thats My Boy. But he's\nhad more hit than miss. He's even proved he can be a dramatic actor in\nhis masterful performance in Punch Drunk Love, which I wish he would\ntry again. So seeing the trailers for this really intrigued me. I knew\nnot to expect much substance. I just knew it was going to be a fun\ncomedy action movie. When the movie was finally in theaters my\npredictions of the unwarranted hateful reviews were spot on. But did\nthat stop me from going to see it? Heck no. I've learned long ago not\nto trust movie critics most of the time. Sometimes their right. This\nisn't one of those times. "

It\nwas hilarious, it had great music, great effects and awesome battles if\nyou loved the 80's and love action/comedy films you will love it if you\nhate Adam Sandler and you think the humor in this film is bad and more\nfor Grown ups instead of young kids then i suggest you to skip it.\n"

It is a great\nmovie for the family to see. This is one Of Adam Sandlers better films\nin the recent years. Pixels is a solid action movie with added humor.\nThis movie is a must see and I assure you that you will not leave the\ntheater unimpressed.

I\nmust say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the\n'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the\nmovie, I turned to my date and said to her, \"This is it! This is the\nmovie!\" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros.\nfinally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film,\napart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's\ndecision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really\nexist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another\naspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus\nbeing on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's\namazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and\nthe creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie\npossible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes\nand the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager\nplaying grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you\nreally don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I\nfelt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too\nquickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was\ngoing on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this\nto the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next\nfilm will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use\nthe martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from\nthose relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm\ndefinitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second\ntime. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.\n"

I was really amazed\nby the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming\nthat they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the\ntalented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary\nOldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better\nactors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the\nintensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to\nencompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even\ngive props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering\nher previous roles consisted of \"the young girl\" or \"girlfriend\".

Nolan\ntries to basically get Shakespearean with the character and completely\nignore the first four films. In some ways that works but in other ways\nit veers off into a Batman universe that makes no sense and becomes\nbasically a movie that seems like he's attempting to have Batman seem\nmore realistic to being like a person in our real universe. This is\nwhere Nolan fails. The magic and fun of Batman evaporates quickly. A\nman dressing up as a bat and fighting crime has a humorous element to\nit that Nolan completely ignores with this incarnation and everyone in\nthis universe acts really dumb about it and their reactions to it make\nlittle sense especially Gordon's character. A lot of what Gordon does\nlacks logical sense and he never seems to really question the mental\nstate of the person he first sees dressed as a bat. He's portrayed like\nsome idiot willing to eventually put complete trust in someone he knows\npractically nothing about running around in a bat suit. His reasons for\nbeing so trusting are never clear. Does he know something everyone else\ndoesn't? Bale's performance was pretty average but not as compelling as\nKeaton or Kilmer. He also tries to have a Batman voice that sounds\nridiculous. The only reason for this film's critical success is that it\nstruck a cord with the comic book fan die hards. It certainly didn't do\nthat impressive box office numbers. Now with news that Nolan is going\nto present The Joker in a sequel, I see a potential disaster waiting to\nhappen.\n"

A rich man who goes out at night in a rubber suit\ndesigned to resemble a bat? Oh, come on! Putting the Caped Crusader in\na film like this is like making 'Austin Powers' the star of a Daniel\nCraig-type Bond film. Worse, the chief villain - The Scarecrow (\nCillian Murphy ) - is another nut, only this one runs round with a sack\non his head! Michael Caine's 'Alfred' cannot hold a Bat-candle either\nto Alan Napier or Michael Gough. The story of this film...well, was\nthere one? All I saw was a lot of fighting with nothing in-between. It\nhas been announced that Warner Bros. are rebooting the franchise once\nmore. Good idea. They need to use the Burton/Schumacher movies as a\ntemplate for any further entries.

He has had some good\nfilms like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a\njoke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making\nfranchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on\nGotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing\nlikeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and\nmore because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes\nbatfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it\nhas an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in\nsucceeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The\nvillain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more\ncorrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to\nclean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and\nlifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely\none to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..\n"

We discover how the billionaire came to be\ntrained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his\ntechnological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance\nas not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the\nmeans to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also\nresponsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we\nnotice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the\nother movies in the series.

                "reviews": "\nThe best film I have seen so far in 2005. It had everything, action and\na little romance. but not enough to distract you from the main story\nline. Forget all the Batman films of the past and look to the future.\nBatman is back, bigger and better. The stunts are great, and add to the\nplot instead of being the hole story. And for once the supporting\nactors don't let you down. They actually boosted the story and helped\nto keep the plot moving in the right direction. Unlike those in the\nBtman films of the past. When Batman Begins comes out on DVD in October\nI will be buying the 2 disc set and I hope you will too. When the next\nBatman film hits the big screen I will be the first in line to see it,\nand being a woman that must mean a great deal.\n"

                "reviews": "\nI can only say what several critics have said before me; at last they\ncapture the essence of the Batman legend on film! What makes this movie\nso great is how it takes its material so seriously. There is also a\nmain theme that ties the movie together: Fear. It's relentless in its\nquest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public\npersona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of\nthe movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a\nmovie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier\nfor the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic\nexperience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films,\nand quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. "

                "reviews": "\nBest Batman. Most rewarding overall cast. Most dutiful to comic. Rich\nsubtext to true fans. About intellect and character over flash and\ndisrespect to depth. Quick motion camera is meant to make you think, as\nfilm is Psychology and Action combined. Batman brings fear to\ncriminals, and the dread of disorientation is what makes him such a\ncompelling mystery. Burton's was great but this is a truer Batman and\nit is only going to get better from here. Its like the Atlas shrugged\nBatman, all about competence over fatalism and decay. Fantastic. The\ncast was dynamic and the pacing was great if you are smart enough to\nnot need padding and ham fisted plot devices or short cuts. It was like\na literary take on the character, as it should be since he has a long\nhistory.\n"

                "reviews": "\nWhat we see in this movie is the \"dark & gritty\" (TM) Batman, which was\nintroduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark\nKnight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But\nMiller also gave the \"real\" comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment\nin the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest\nBatman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the\nexcellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things,\nBruce Wayne's initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote\nmountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank\nMiller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics\ncreators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting\nconsistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the\nentire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit."

                "reviews": "\nThis movie was absolutely dreadful. Christian Bale as Batman was just\nabsolutely ridiculous not to mention Michael Caine with his accent.\nThere were several points in the movie I burst out laughing at Bale's\ndelivery of lines. It was like he practically growled as if to sound\nmenacing. I think the public at large just has no idea what is an\naccurate portrayal of Bob Kane's comic character. To me the closest I\nthink was the original 1989 Batman movie. The absurdity of Batman\nBegins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it\nrather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain\nof any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just\ndownright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who\nhave stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad.\nUnfortunately a new generation of children think this is cooler than a\nBatman that makes much more sense and has an element of fun to it.\nTedious and bland is the only way to describe this new reinvention of\nthe Dark Knight. Next!\n"

So, you may imagine my surprise to discover that Batman\nBegins is not only better than the previous Batmans but much better.\nThe genesis of the character as well as inedited insights into the\nseven mystery years in the life of Bruce Wayne makes the whole\nenterprise engaging even thrilling. Christian Bale is an American\nPsycho Batman, pouty lips and unexpected sexual presence. Katie Holmes\nis lovely, with a sharp intelligence and a riveting imperfect beauty.\nMichael Caine fills the shoes of the butler with wit and charm. Gary\nOldman, looking more Oldman than Gary, adds another surprising\ncharacterization to his already impressive gallery. So, very nice.\nThere is still hope in hopeless trends. Who knew.\n"
